# Pharmacy Settings, Personnel, & Services

## Pharmacy Personnel

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the pharmacist's skill or expertise.

### Pharmacy Clerk/ Assistant

Pharmacy clerks (also called assistants) are **unlicensed personnel** who support front-end operations and customer service. They typically need only a high school diploma and on-the-job training. Their duties include:

- **Customer Service**: Greeting customers, answering phones, accepting prescriptions
- **Data Entry**: Inputting patient and insurance information into the pharmacy system
- **Inventory Tasks**: Stocking shelves, checking stock levels, receiving shipments
- **Payment Processing**: Handling customer payments and receipts
- **Clerical Work**: Filing records, organizing paperwork

> 📍 In some states, clerks may not be permitted to enter or access prescription data.

### Pharmacy Technicians (PhT)

Pharmacy technicians are **healthcare professionals** who assist pharmacists with technical tasks. In some states, techs are only registered, not licensed. At minimum states require that technicians are **registered (and usually licensed)**, while some employers may also require **national certification**. Their scope of practice typically includes:

- **Prescription Processing**: Receiving and processing medication orders, measuring and preparing dosages
- **Labeling**: Packaging and labeling medications with usage instructions
- **Insurance Processing**: Assisting with insurance claims and patient billing
- **Compounding**: Preparing sterile and non-sterile medications under pharmacist supervision
- **Patient Records**: Collecting and entering patient data into pharmacy systems
- **Inventory Management**: Monitoring stock and notifying pharmacists of shortages

### Pharmacist Interns

Interns are pharmacy students enrolled in a PharmD program and working under a **pharmacist’s supervision**. They typically hold an **intern license**. Responsibilities include:

- **Patient Interaction**: Taking medication histories and verifying prescriptions
- **Medication Prep**: Counting, packaging, and labeling prescriptions
- **Administrative Support**: Entering data, monitoring inventory, and maintaining records

### Pharmacist

Pharmacists are healthcare professionals licensed to **dispense medications**, **counsel patients**, and **oversee pharmacy operations**. They must hold a **Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)** degree and pass the **NAPLEX and MPJE** for licensure. Their duties include:

- **Prescription Review**: Ensuring accuracy, safety, and clarity in filled prescriptions
- **Patient Education**: Explaining medication use, side effects, and safety
- **Drug Interaction Checks**: Monitoring for potential medication conflicts
- **Administering Vaccines**: Providing immunizations (as allowed by state law)
- **Health Screenings**: Conducting blood pressure checks and other basic screenings

### (Situational) Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs)

NPs and PAs are **advanced practice providers** who are licensed to diagnose, treat, and prescribe medications. Their authority varies by state, but they often function similarly to physicians in outpatient settings.

- **Prescribing Authority**: Can write prescriptions for both non-controlled and controlled substances (depending on state law and DEA registration)
- **Collaborative Practice**: Often work under a supervising or collaborating physician
- **Vaccinations**: Can administer and prescribe vaccines
- **Pharmacy Role**: Pharmacy personnel often verify NP/PA credentials and DEA numbers when filling prescriptions

## Services Offered

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

A process to ensure the most accurate, complete list of all medications a patient is taking—name, dose, route, and frequency—by comparing current medical records with patient and provider sources.  

Especially critical for:

- Emergency Department admissions
- Hospitalist-managed patients
- Patients with **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
- Transfers from **Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**

### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> 📍 MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🛡️ HIPAA Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.

#### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. Herd Immunity is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune; which is critical for the protection of public health.

To support public health through vaccine efforts, pharmacies offer immunization services.

🧑‍⚕️ **Roles in Nuclear Pharmacy**

- **Pharmacists**:
  - Verify orders and calculate radiopharmaceutical doses
  - Prepare, label, and release sterile preparations
  - Ensure compliance with NRC and state laws

- **Pharmacy Technicians** (certified with specialized training):
  - Assist in preparation under pharmacist supervision
  - Perform routine quality control tests
  - Maintain inventory of radioactive and non-radioactive materials
  - Handle packaging, labeling, and radiation shielding

> 📍 All personnel must complete radiation safety training before handling radioactive materials.

🧑‍🔬 **Safety & Personal Monitoring**

All personnel working with radioactive materials must wear **dosimetry devices** to monitor exposure:

| Device | Placement | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Ring Badge** | On dominant hand | Monitors extremity exposure | Weekly |
| **Body Badge** | Shirt collar or chest  | Monitors whole-body exposure | Monthly |
| **Fetal Badge**| Near abdomen | Required for pregnant personnel | Monthly |

> ☣️ Dosimetry results are reviewed regularly to ensure exposure stays below federal and institutional limits.

🛠️ **Physical Layout**

- **Restricted Areas**:
  - Order entry
  - Compounding and preparation
  - Dispensing and storage of radioactive materials  
  - 📍 Access limited to trained personnel only

- **Unrestricted Areas**:
  - Administrative spaces and break rooms
  - Minimal or no contact with radioactive substances

🧪 **Radiopharmaceutical Orders**

Nuclear pharmacy prescription orders must include **four elements** in addition to standard prescription requirements:

1. **Radiopharmaceutical agent** (e.g., Technetium-99m)
2. **Amount of radioactivity** (e.g., in millicuries, mCi)
3. **Time of administration**
4. **Patient name**

Most radiopharmaceuticals are dispensed as **unit doses** in:

- **3–5 mL syringes**
- Placed inside **shielded lead containers** (called "pigs") for radiation protection
