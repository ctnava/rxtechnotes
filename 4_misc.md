## Formularies

**Formularies** (i.e. a list of drugs approved and made available for use) are often used to decide which medications to dispense to patients. In a hospital setting, it refers to drugs that are stocked by the pharmacy and approved for use in the facility. In retail, it refers to an approved drug list associated with a particular insurance benefit plan. In every case, every drug is identified by their 11-digit NDC.

### Generic Substitution

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.
