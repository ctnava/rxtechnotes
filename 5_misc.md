## ðŸ’§ Common IV Solutions

| Abbreviation | Full Name                            | Composition                                  | Osmolarity (Relative to Blood) | Clinical Use / Indication                                   | Special Considerations |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| NS           | Normal Saline                         | 0.9% Sodium Chloride in Water                | Isotonic                      | Hydration, fluid resuscitation, compatible with most meds, drug administration, surgical irrigation, commonly used in surgery, trauma, and emergency situations   | Can cause hyperchloremic acidosis with large volumes, not ideal for patients with conditions like heart failure due to sodium content |
| 1/2NS        | Half Normal Saline                    | 0.45% Sodium Chloride in Water               | Hypotonic                     | Maintenance fluids, chronic dehydration, hypertonic dehydration, used for hydration when less sodium is needed                  | Avoid in head trauma or hyponatremia, not suitable for resuscitation, caution in patietnts with liver disease as it can exacerbate fluid shifts |
| D5W          | 5% Dextrose in Water                  | 5g Dextrose per 100mL Water                  | Isotonic* â†’ Hypotonic in body | Treat hypoglycemia, provide calories for patients who cannot eat, Hydration, diluent for certain medications | Avoid in diabetics; becomes hypotonic after metabolism, not a source of electrolytes |
| D5NS         | Dextrose 5% in 0.9% Sodium Chloride   | 5g Dextrose + 0.9% NaCl per 100mL Water       | Hypertonic                    | Provides calories and sodium; treat hypoglycemia, used post-op or for NPO pts   | Monitor for fluid overload; avoid in renal or cardiac pts |
| LR (RL)      | Lactated Ringerâ€™s Solution            | NaCl, KCl, CaClâ‚‚, Sodium Lactate in Water     | Isotonic                      | fluid replacement with hydration and glucose, acute blood loss, used in surgery, trauma, & burn recovery, corrects metabolic acidosis | Contains potassiumâ€”use cautiously in renal failure     |
| SW or SWFI   | Sterile Water for Injection           | Sterile Water (no solutes)                   | Hypotonic                     | Used to dilute or reconstitute medications, irrigation of wounds | NEVER give IV pushâ€”risk of hemolysis                  |

> *D5W is isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic once glucose is metabolized.
