🔄 **Rules for Determining Insurance Hierarchy for Coordination of Benefits (COB)**

When patients have more than one plan, which can sometimes be revealed by Third Party Rejections (e.g. “other coverage primary"), they must be billed in correct order (i.e. primary → secondary → tertiary).

The correct order of insurance coverage is based on **standard coordination rules** used by insurers and PBMs. Pharmacy technicians must gather all active insurance cards and apply the following logic when entering insurance plans:

1. **Non-Medicare Adults (Two or More Private Insurances)**
   - The plan that **covers the patient as a subscriber** (employee, policyholder) is **primary**.
   - The plan that **covers the patient as a dependent** (e.g., through a spouse) is **secondary**.
2. **Dependent Children: The Birthday Rule**
   - The parent whose **birth month and day (MM/DD)** occurs first in the calendar year has the **primary plan**.
     - Example: Parent A (March 10) vs. Parent B (July 5) → Parent A’s plan is primary.
     - 📌 The year of birth is *not* considered—only month and day.
   - If both parents share the same birthday, the plan that has **covered the parent longer** becomes primary.
3. **Children with Divorced or Separated Parents**
   - If a court order specifies which parent is financially responsible for healthcare, **follow that order**.
   - If no court order:
     1. The plan of the parent **with custody** is primary.
     2. Then the plan of the **custodial parent’s spouse** (stepparent) is secondary.
     3. The plan of the **non-custodial parent** is tertiary.
4. **Tricare and VA**
   - **VA prescriptions must be filled at VA pharmacies**. Do not bill Tricare or commercial plans for VA-issued scripts.
   - **Tricare** may be primary or secondary depending on whether the patient has other coverage. Confirm eligibility through Tricare’s system.
5. **Medicare Coordination Rules**
   - **Medicare is usually secondary** if:
     - The patient is **still actively working** and covered by an **employer group health plan** (EGHP).
     - The patient has **retiree insurance** or a **union-sponsored plan** that pays first.
   - **Medicare is primary** if:
     - The patient has **no other insurance** or only has **Medicare Part D** for prescriptions.
   - 🦅x🐻 Some patients may have both **Medi-Cal** and **Medicare**. In that case, Medicare is billed first, and **Medi-Cal is the payer of last resort**.

🤖 **Rule Overrides**

> 🛡️ Choose the **correct rule** based on the **patient's situation**.

| Rule Type | Use When | Overrides Other Rules? |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| **Subscriber vs. Dependent** | Two private insurances on an adult | Applies only to adults |
| **Birthday Rule** | Two parents insuring a child, no divorce | Yes, takes precedence over subscriber rule for children |
| **Divorce Rule** | Child of divorced or separated parents | Yes, overrides the birthday rule |
| **Medicare Coordination** | Patient has Medicare + other coverage | Medicare’s federal rules override private plan conventions |
| **Tricare / VA** | Military or veteran coverage involved | VA prescriptions not billed externally; Tricare billing rules apply separately |
| 🐻 **Medi-Cal as Payer of Last Resort** | Dual-eligible patients in CA | Yes, Medi-Cal always billed last |

> 🛡️ Refer unclear COB issues to pharmacist or billing staff.

## 🧾 Clinical Documentation

### 🧪 Allergies

Ask: “Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?”

- Record all allergies (medications, food, environment)
- If none, document as **NKA** (No Known Allergies)

Ask if the patient has any diagnosed conditions, chronic or acute:

- Examples: Asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension

### 💊 Medication History

Ask for a **complete list** of:

- Prescription medications
- OTC drugs (e.g., acetaminophen, diphenhydramine)
- Vitamins and supplements
- Herbal or homeopathic products

**Ask targeted questions** to capture missed items:  
> “Do you take anything for sleep, pain, or colds?”

OTC medications are not automatically safe. They can cause:

- **Drug interactions**
- **Duplicate therapy**
- **Toxicity** (e.g., acetaminophen overuse)
