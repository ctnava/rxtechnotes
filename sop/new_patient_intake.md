### Clinical Documentation

#### Allergies

Ask: “Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?”

- Record any allergies (drug, food, environmental)  
- If none, enter **NKA** (No Known Allergies)

#### Health Conditions

Record any relevant chronic or acute conditions the patient reports. Examples:

- Diabetes  
- Hypertension  
- Asthma  
- Epilepsy  

#### Medication Reconciliation

Ask for a **complete list** of:

- Current prescription medications
- Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs

**Ask targeted questions** to capture missed items:  
> “Do you take anything for headaches, muscle pain, or colds?”

##### ⚠️ Hidden Dangers of OTC Drugs

**Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are not inherently safe** just because they don’t require a prescription. Many OTC medications can cause significant drug interactions, adverse effects, or even life-threatening complications; especially when combined with prescription drugs or taken incorrectly.
