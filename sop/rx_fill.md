# üõ†Ô∏è SOP - Filling Prescriptions (Retail)

## üîë Objectives

- Ensure accuracy of medication selection and labeling  
- Minimize waste by using returned-to-stock and near-expiry inventory first  
- Comply with labeling, packaging, and verification requirements  
- Maintain proper documentation and safety protocols

> üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è All prescriptions must undergo a **final check by the pharmacist** prior to release to the patient. This SOP outlines the standard procedure for **retail pharmacy prescription fills** that do **not** involve compounding, liquids, unit-dose packaging, or hazardous materials.

1. üìã **Pre-Fill Preparation**
   1. **Prescription Receipt**
      - Prescription is entered and verified in the pharmacy software system.
      - A **prescription pamphlet** is printed at the prescription counter with patient, drug, and prescriber information.
   2. **Medication Retrieval**
      - Technician locates the correct medication by verifying the **National Drug Code (NDC)** on the prescription pamphlet.
      - Follow this inventory selection priority:
        1. ‚úÖ **Returned-to-stock vials** that are labeled and properly stored
        2. ‚úÖ **Opened stock bottles** that are not expired
        3. ‚úÖ **Sealed stock bottles** closest to expiration
      - Mark any newly opened stock bottle as **"opened"** to maintain inventory control.
2. üß™ **Verification and Labeling**
   1. **System Scanning**
      - At the prescription counter:
        - Scan the **prescription pamphlet** barcode
        - Scan the **1D vial barcode** or **2D NDC barcode** on the stock bottle
      - This step ensures the **correct drug, dosage, and manufacturer** match the system record.
   2. **Label Generation**
      - Once the system confirms the NDC match:
        - Print the **prescription label**
        - Print **auxiliary warning labels** as required
        - Ensure label includes:
          - Patient name
          - Drug name and strength
          - Prescriber name
          - Directions for use
          - Refill information
          - Pharmacy information
          - Prescription number
3. ‚öñÔ∏è **Portioning & Packaging**
   1. **Counting Medication**
      - Pour medication onto a **counting tray**
      - Use the **count-by-5 method** unless otherwise directed
      - Cross-check total quantity against the prescribed amount
   2. **Bottling**
      - Transfer counted medication into the appropriate vial
      - Affix:
        - Prescription label
        - Auxiliary warning labels (e.g. "May cause drowsiness", "Take with food")
      - Seal the bottle with a **safety cap**
      - Return unused tablets to the correct stock container immediately
4. üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Final Review & Documentation**
   1. **Pharmacist Verification**
      - Set completed prescription in the **designated verification area**
      - Pharmacist checks:
        - NDC accuracy
        - Correct quantity
        - Label integrity
        - Drug appearance and consistency
        - Patient profile alerts or contraindications
   2. **Patient Package Insert (PPI)**
      - For drugs requiring a PPI (e.g. estrogens, isotretinoin):
        - Pharmacist prints and attaches PPI to the prescription
        - üì∞ These must be dispensed **each time the drug is provided**, regardless of refill
5. ‚úÖ **Stage for Pickup**
   - Place completed and verified prescription in a **pickup bag** with proper labeling
   - Alphabetize bag by **patient last name**
   - Return scanned pamphlet to appropriate filing system

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- Double-check expiration dates during stock selection  
- Never mix different lots or manufacturers in the same bottle  
- Use auxiliary labels based on the most current system prompts  
- If there is a mismatch or uncertainty, always **pause and alert the pharmacist**
