# 🔁 SOP - Refill Requests

Each prescription is assigned a **prescription number**, which stays the same for all refills. The number of authorized refills is written by the prescriber and usually printed on the **prescription label**. If a doctor writes refills (sometimes denoted with “PRN”), they are valid for **up to 1 year** from the date the prescription was written, **except for controlled substances**, which have stricter limits.

| Drug Type | Refill Limit | Validity |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| 🧪 **Non-controlled substances** | As prescribed | Up to 1 year |
| 💊 **Schedule III–V controlled substances** | Max **5 refills** | Within **6 months** of issue date |
| 🚫 **Schedule II controlled substances** | **Not refillable** | New Rx required each time |

> 🔐 Schedule II prescriptions **cannot be refilled** under any circumstance. A new prescription must be issued each time.

## 📝 Requesting New Prescriptions from Prescribers

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: In **inpatient** or **institutional** settings, refill protocols may differ.

When a prescription has **no refills remaining** or has **expired**, **pharmacy technicians** may contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription. This typically occurs when a patient:

- Calls the pharmacy
- Uses a mobile app or website
- Requests refills through secure electronic systems (e.g. EDI)

> 🚨 These requests are generally *not* used for controlled substances in outpatient settings, especially not for Schedule II drugs.

### 1. Gather Required Information

- 😀 Patient’s full name & date of birth | To Identify the Patient
- 💊 Medication name, strength, & quantity | To Identify Prescription
- 🔢 Prescription number | (if applicable)
- 📅 Last fill date | To Verify Eligibility
- 🚨 Level of urgency | For Triage
- 🏥 Additional identifiers **if inpatient** (e.g. Hospital ID, Room/Bed, Indication for Use)

### 2. Confirm Correct Prescriber

- Verify provider name and contact information before disclosing PHI

### 3. Make the Call

- Use the following script:
    > “Hello, this is **[Your Name]** calling from **[Pharmacy Name]**. I’m calling to request a medication refill for a patient.”
- Then provide the following details:
  - “Last name: [Patient Last Name], Date of birth: [DOB]”
  - “Medication: [Drug Name, Strength], Quantity: [##]”
  - “Last filled on: [MM/DD/YYYY]”
  - State urgency (if applicable):  
      > “This is the patient’s emergency heart medication (Nitrostat), and they are on their last dose.”

### 4. Provide Pharmacy Contact Information

- Phone and fax number

### 5. Documentation

Record the following:

- Date and time of the call
- Name of the receptionist (if applicable)
- Outcome or notes
- Pharmacy contact information given

### 6. Voicemail Protocol

- Leave voicemail **only** if the number is verified as a provider’s permanent line
  - Include all necessary information outlined above
- If line is **not verified**, only leave your name, pharmacy name, and callback information
- Document the time, date, and message status (e.g. “left voicemail at 11:55AM on 05/17/2025”)

> ✅ Speak slowly, clearly, and succinctly. Use the NATO alphabet when spelling.

## 🗎 Alternate Request Methods

- Secure EDI portals
- Fax forms with a **blank cover page** to prevent accidental PHI disclosure
