# 🔁 SOP - Refill Requests

Each prescription is assigned a **prescription number**, which stays the same for all refills. The number of authorized refills is written by the prescriber and usually printed on the **prescription label**. If a doctor authorizes multiple refills (often written as ‘Refills: 3’ or ‘Refills: PRN’), they are valid for **up to 1 year** from the date the prescription was written, **except for controlled substances**, which have stricter limits.

| Drug Type | Refill Limit | Validity |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| 🧪 **Non-controlled substances** | As prescribed | Up to 1 year |
| 💊 **Schedule III–V controlled substances** | Max **5 refills** | Within **6 months** of issue date |
| 🚫 **Schedule II controlled substances** | **Not refillable** under any circumstance. | New Rx required each time |

> 🔐 Controlled substances, especially Schedule II, may require EPCS (Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances). Fax requests are generally not permitted for Schedule II unless an exemption applies. Secure EDI systems may be used for Schedule III–V medications when allowed.

## 📝 Prescription Renewal Requests (New Rx Requests)

When a prescription has no refills or is expired, the technician is requesting a new prescription, not a ‘refill’ in the legal sense.

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: In **inpatient** or **institutional** settings, refill protocols may differ.

**Pharmacy technicians** may be authorized to contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription. This typically occurs when a patient:

- Calls the pharmacy
- Uses a mobile app or website
- Requests refills through secure electronic systems (e.g. EDI)

> 🚨 In outpatient settings, prescription renewal requests are typically not made for controlled substances, especially Schedule II medications, which require new prescriptions issued directly by the prescriber.

### 1. Gather Required Information

- 😀 Patient’s full name & date of birth | To Identify the Patient
- 💊 Medication name, strength, & quantity | To Identify Prescription
- 🔢 Prescription number | (from the last fill, if needed for reference)
- 📅 Last fill date | To Verify Eligibility
- 🚨 Level of urgency | For Triage
- 🏥 Additional identifiers **if inpatient** (e.g. Hospital ID, Room/Bed, Indication for Use)

### 2. Confirm Correct Prescriber

- Verify provider name and contact information before disclosing PHI

### 3. Make the Call

- Use the following script:
    > “Hello, this is **[Your Name]** calling from **[Pharmacy Name]**. I’m calling to request a medication refill for a patient.”
- Then provide the following details:
  - “Last name: [Patient Last Name], Date of birth: [DOB]”
  - “Medication: [Drug Name, Strength], Quantity: [##]”
  - “Last filled on: [MM/DD/YYYY]”
  - State urgency (if applicable):  
      > “This is the patient’s emergency heart medication (Nitrostat), and they are on their last dose.”

### 4. Provide Pharmacy Contact Information

- Phone and fax number

### 5. Documentation

Record the following:

- Date and time of the call
- Name of the receptionist (if applicable)
- Outcome or notes
- Pharmacy contact information given

### 6. Voicemail Protocol

- Leave voicemail **only** if the number is verified as a provider’s permanent line
  - Include all necessary information outlined above
- If line is **not verified**, only leave your name, pharmacy name, and callback information
- Document the time, date, and message status (e.g. “left voicemail at 11:55AM on 05/17/2025”)

> ✅ Speak slowly, clearly, and succinctly. Use the NATO alphabet when spelling.

## 🗎 Alternate Request Methods

- Secure EDI portals
- Fax forms with a **blank cover page** to prevent accidental PHI disclosure
