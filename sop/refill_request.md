# 🔁 SOP - Refill Requests

When a prescription has **no refills remaining** or has **expired** (after 1 year from the written date), **pharmacy technicians** may contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription. This typically occurs when a patient:

- Calls the pharmacy
- Uses a mobile app or website
- Requests refills through secure electronic systems (e.g. EDI)

## 📝 Standard Refill Request Procedure

In **inpatient** or **institutional** settings, refill protocols may differ.

### 1. Gather Required Information

- 😀 Patient’s full name & date of birth | To Identify the Patient
- 💊 Medication name, strength, & quantity | To Identify Prescription
- 🔢 Prescription number | (if applicable)
- 📅 Last fill date | To Verify Eligibility
- 🚨 Level of urgency | For Triage
- 🏥 Additional identifiers **if inpatient** (e.g. Hospital ID, Room/Bed, Indication for Use)

### 2. Confirm Correct Prescriber

- Verify provider name and contact information before disclosing PHI

### 3. Make the Call

- Use the following script:
    > “Hello, this is **[Your Name]** calling from **[Pharmacy Name]**. I’m calling to request a medication refill for a patient.”

- Then Provide

- “Last name: [Patient Last Name], Date of birth: [DOB]”
- “Medication: [Drug Name, Strength], Quantity: [##]”
- “Last filled on: [MM/DD/YYYY]”
- State urgency (if applicable):  
    > “This is the patient’s emergency heart medication (Nitrostat), and they are on their last dose.”

### 4. Provide Pharmacy Contact Information

- Phone and fax number

### 5. Documentation

Record the following:

- Date and time of the call
- Name of the receptionist (if applicable)
- Outcome or notes
- Pharmacy contact information given

### 6. Voicemail Protocol

- Leave voicemail **only** if the number is verified as a provider’s permanent line
  - Include all necessary information outlined above
- If line is **not verified**, only leave your name, pharmacy name, and callback information
- Document the time, date, and message status (e.g. “left voicemail at 11:55AM on 05/17/2025”)

> ✅ Speak slowly, clearly, and succinctly. Use the NATO alphabet when spelling.

## 🗎 Alternate Request Methods

- Secure EDI portals
- Fax forms with a **blank cover page** to prevent accidental PHI disclosure
