| Palm to palm with fingers interlaced      | Web spaces                 |
| Backs of fingers to opposing palms        | Knuckles                  |
| Rotational rubbing of thumbs              | Thumbs                     |
| Rotational rubbing of fingertips          | Fingertips and nails       |

- Use **nail pick** to clean under fingernails
- Scrub hands, then scrub forearms **up to the elbows**
- Use **rough side** of brush for scrubbing; **smooth side** for rinsing

> ‚è±Ô∏è Scrubbing should take **at least 30‚Äì60 seconds** per hand/arm section

### Step 3: Rinsing

1. Rinse hands and forearms thoroughly under **sterile water**, **hands elevated above elbows**.
2. Let water flow from fingertips toward elbows (never the reverse).
3. Avoid contact with sink surfaces at all times.

---

### Step 4: Drying

- Dry hands and forearms with a **lint-free disposable towel**
- Pat gently, do not rub
- Use a **new towel for each hand** if necessary
- Dispose of towels in designated receptacle

---

### Step 5: IPA Disinfection (if applicable)

- After gowning and gloving, spray gloved hands with **70% Isopropyl Alcohol**
- Allow alcohol to **air dry completely** before proceeding to sterile work

---

## ü©∫ Aftercare

- Apply lotion **after shifts**, not during compounding activities
- Report and cover any cuts, burns, or skin conditions before entering cleanroom

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes & Best Practices
