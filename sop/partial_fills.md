# 🔁 SOP - Partial Fills

A **partial fill** occurs when the pharmacy dispenses **less than the full prescribed quantity** of a medication. This is typically due to **insufficient inventory**. The remainder is dispensed later once stock is available or as permitted by law.

## 📦 Non-Controlled Medications

### When to Partial Fill

- **Inventory shortage**: Stock insufficient to fill full prescription.
- **Patient request**: Cost concerns, travel, or personal preference.
- **Inventory stewardship**: Prevent stock depletion to serve multiple patients.

### Best Practices

- Dispense **only enough** to bridge the gap until inventory is replenished.
- Avoid full depletion of shared or limited stock.

### Copay Collection

- **Do not collect** copay during the initial partial fill.
- **Collect the full copay** only when the entire prescribed quantity has been dispensed.

### Follow-Up Steps

- **Notify** the patient when the remainder is available.
- **Document** the partial fill in the pharmacy system:
  - Quantity dispensed
  - Date dispensed
  - Remaining quantity
- Ensure that the **total dispensed matches** the original prescription.

## 🔒 Controlled Substances

### Schedule II (CII)

Regulated under the **Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 829)**, **21 CFR § 1306.13**, **DEA Final Rule/ CARA (2016)**, and **California Health & Safety Code § 11153.5**.

Partial fills are allowed **only** under specific conditions:

#### 1. Out-of-Stock Scenario

- Allowed to dispense a partial amount if full quantity is unavailable.
- **Remainder must be filled within 72 hours** of initial dispensing.
- If not completed in 72 hours:
  - **Notify the prescriber.**
  - **Void the remainder.**
  - A new prescription is required for any additional dispensing.

#### 2. Patient or Prescriber Request

Allowed under the Federal **Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA, 2016)** and California State law:

- Partial fills permitted **at the request** of the patient or prescriber.
- **Remainder must be filled within 30 days** of the original written date.
- Applies to:
  - General outpatient prescriptions (if requested)
  - **LTCF (Long-Term Care Facility)** residents
  - **Terminally ill** patients

> 🧠 Must annotate “LTCF” or “terminally ill” on the prescription or system record when applicable.

#### Refusal of Remaining Quantity (CII)

If a patient **refuses** the remainder of a partial CII fill:

- **Pharmacist must document**:
  - The refusal
  - Date of refusal
  - Quantity already dispensed
  - Statement that the remainder was not requested
- **Void the remaining quantity** in the system. It **must not be dispensed later** unless a new prescription is issued.
- **Notify the prescriber** that the patient declined the remainder.
- In California, this action must be documented in a manner that is **readily retrievable** for Board of Pharmacy inspection.
- The original prescription is considered **closed** once the patient declines the remaining portion.

> 🔒 *California law aligns with federal CARA provisions and permits partial CII fills at patient request. Refusals must be fully documented and reported to the prescriber.*

### Schedule III–V (CIII–CV)

Permitted under **21 CFR § 1306.23**.

- Partial fills are allowed for **any legitimate reason** (no restrictions like CII).
- All partial fills must occur **within 6 months** of the prescription issue date.
- Total dispensed amount **must not exceed** the original prescription quantity.

### Required Documentation (All Schedules)

For each partial fill of any controlled substance:

- Date of fill
- Quantity dispensed
- Remaining quantity
- Pharmacist initials
- Reason/criteria if applicable (e.g., LTCF, terminal illness, CARA request)

---

## ✅ Final Reminders

- Always check **state-specific laws**; some states are more restrictive than federal law.
- Never exceed the original total prescribed quantity across all fills.
- Controlled substance decisions should always be verified with a pharmacist.
- Maintain **complete and accurate records** for DEA and state auditing purposes.
