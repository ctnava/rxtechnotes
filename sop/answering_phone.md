## Procedure

### 📞 Call Answering Protocol

1. Answer the phone within **3 rings**, if possible.
2. Greet the caller and identify the pharmacy by **name**:
   - Example: “Thank you for calling [Pharmacy Name], this is [Your Name], how can I help you?”
3. Use a **calm, courteous tone** and speak clearly.
4. If the caller is a **patient** or calling about a specific patient:
   - Ask for **at least two patient identifiers**:
     - Full name
     - Date of birth
     - Address (if needed)
5. Actively **listen**, do not interrupt
6. Confirm understanding by **repeating the concern or request** back to the caller.
7. Refer to patients by name when appropriate.

> ✅ Maintain professionalism and empathy, especially with elderly, confused, or frustrated patients.
