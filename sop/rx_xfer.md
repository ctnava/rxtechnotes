# 🛠️ SOP - Prescription Transfers

Prescriptions may be transferred between pharmacies at the **request of the patient**. This process ensures continuity of care and allows patients to access their medications more conveniently. The transfer of prescriptions is regulated by **federal law** and further defined by **state law**, with specific rules depending on the drug schedule and type.

Pharmacy technicians **may not** perform the actual transfer of the prescription. However, they **assist** by preparing the necessary information and coordinating communication.

> 🩺 Both pharmacists will record each other's information during the transfer.

## 🦅 Federal & 🐻 California Rules

- **Non-controlled (Legend) Drugs**:  
  - May be transferred **unlimited times** between licensed pharmacies, as long as the prescription has valid refills remaining.
- **Controlled Substances (Schedules III–V)**:  
  - Under **21 CFR §1306.25**, may be transferred **once only**, unless both pharmacies share a **real-time, shared database**.
  - 🐻 In California, the pharmacist must **document** the transfer thoroughly and **verify DEA registration** of the receiving pharmacy.
- **Schedule II Drugs**:  
  - 🛑 **Cannot be transferred** under any circumstances. These require a new written or electronic prescription.

## 🔄 Standard Transfer Workflow

Pharmacy technicians **may not** perform the actual transfer of the prescription. However, they **assist** by preparing the necessary information and coordinating communication.

1. **Patient Initiates Request**
   - The **receiving pharmacy** is contacted by the patient.
   - A technician or clerk takes the initial call.

2. **Collect Transfer Details**
   - Confirm and record the following:
     - 🧑 **Patient Name** and **Date of Birth**
     - ☎️ **Phone number** of the patient (if follow-up is needed)
     - 🏥 **Name**, **phone number**, and **location** of the pharmacy currently holding the prescription
     - 💊 **Medication name** and **prescription number** (if available)

3. **Notify the Pharmacist**
   - Relay all gathered information to the pharmacist.
   - The pharmacist will:
     - Call or electronically contact the sending pharmacy
     - Document the transfer per regulatory requirements
     - Confirm remaining refills, original prescription date, and prescriber info
     - Log DEA numbers for **controlled substance** transfers (if applicable)

## 🛡️ Compliance & Documentation

- Pharmacists must record:
  - Original date of issue and dispensing
  - Number of refills authorized and remaining
  - Dates and locations of previous fills
  - Transferring and receiving pharmacy information
  - Names of both transferring and receiving pharmacists
- The prescription must be **marked as voided** at the transferring pharmacy once the transfer is completed.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always confirm the **legal transferability** of the drug before initiating any process.
- Avoid delays by having **complete and accurate information** ready for the pharmacist.
- For **controlled substances**, ensure only one transfer occurs unless both pharmacies are in a **shared database system** (e.g. chain pharmacies).
- When in doubt, ask the pharmacist before proceeding with any part of the process.
