# Chapter 4: Healthcare Coverage

## 💊 Formularies

A **formulary** is an official list of prescription medications that are **approved for use** and covered by an institution or insurance plan. Formularies guide what medications can be **dispensed, substituted, or reimbursed**.

🏥 **In Hospital/Institutional Settings**:

- The formulary includes only the medications stocked and approved by the Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) Committee.
- Medications not on the formulary may require a non-formulary request or therapeutic substitution.
- Helps ensure cost-effective, evidence-based treatment for inpatients.

🛍️ **In Retail/Insurance Settings**:

- The formulary is the list of covered drugs under a patient’s insurance plan, usually managed by a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM).
- Medications are divided into tiers:
  - Tier 1: Preferred generics (lowest cost)
  - Tier 2: Preferred brand-name drugs
  - Tier 3: Non-preferred brands or specialty drugs
  - Tier 4+: High-cost or specialty medications (higher copay/coinsurance)
- Drugs not on the formulary may be denied coverage, unless a prior authorization is approved.

> 📋 **A National Drug Code (NDC)** — a unique 11-digit number — identifies each drug by manufacturer, product, and package size, and is used to match drugs to the correct formulary coverage.

### Generic Substitution

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.

## 🏢 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)

A PBM is a third-party company that manages the prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance plans, employers, Medicare Part D plans, and other payers.

PBMs act as a middleman between:

- 💊 Pharmacies
- 🏥 Health insurers/employers
- 🏭 Drug manufacturers

| Role | PBM Responsibility |
|------|--------------------|
| 🛍️ **Claims Processing** | PBMs process prescription claims when a patient fills a medication at a pharmacy. |
| 💲 **Reimbursement Rates** | They determine how much pharmacies are paid and how much the patient pays (copay/coinsurance). |
| 📋 **Formulary Management** | PBMs design **formularies**—lists of covered drugs—and place them into **tiers** that affect pricing and access. |
| 🔐 **Prior Authorizations (PAs)** | PBMs require PAs for certain high-cost or high-risk drugs to control costs. |
| 🤝 **Manufacturer Rebates** | PBMs negotiate **rebates** and **discounts** from drug manufacturers in exchange for preferred placement on formularies. |
| 📦 **Mail-Order Pharmacy** | Many PBMs operate or partner with **mail-order pharmacies** for 90-day supplies or specialty meds. |

🧠 **Why It Matters for Pharmacy Technicians**:

- PBMs influence what is covered, how much patients pay, and how pharmacies get reimbursed.
- When a drug isn’t covered or needs a PA, it’s usually the PBM’s rules, not the pharmacy’s.
- Pharmacy techs often use PBM portals to:
  - Submit or check claims
  - Review drug coverage
  - Confirm copays and eligibility
  - Assist with troubleshooting denials

> 💡 **Common PBMs**: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, & OptumRx manage drug benefits for millions of patients nationwide.

## Health Insurance

Pharmacy technicians often need to help patients navigate insurance issues. Knowing the basics of health plans and cost-sharing terms helps with billing, resolving coverage issues, and referrals to pharmacists.

| Term | What It Means | Key Info |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 📅 **Enrollment** | The period when a patient can **sign up for or change** a plan. | Typically during **open enrollment** (fall) or due to a **qualifying life event** (e.g., marriage, loss of coverage). |
| 💵 **Premium** | The **monthly payment** for health insurance, paid **regardless of use**. | Higher premium plans often have lower out-of-pocket costs. |
| 💳 **Deductible** | The amount a patient pays **before insurance starts covering**. | Some plans cover certain drugs or visits even before deductible is met. |
| 💸 **Copayment (Copay)** | A **fixed amount** (e.g., \$10 or \$50) paid for a service or medication. | Often applies to Tier 1–3 drugs. |
| 📊 **Coinsurance** | A **percentage** the patient pays after meeting the deductible (e.g., 20%). | More common in higher tiers or for specialty meds. |
| ⛔ **Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOP Max)** | The **most a patient will pay** in a year (including deductible, copays, coinsurance). | Once met, plan pays **100%** of covered services. |

> 💡 Pharmacy staff may need to explain that a prescription isn’t covered yet because the deductible hasn't been met, or that a prior authorization is required.

### Private Health Insurance

| Plan Type | Description | Referrals Needed? | Out-of-Network Coverage? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 🟦 **HMO** (Health Maintenance Organization) | Most restrictive. Requires you to choose a **Primary Care Provider (PCP)** who coordinates all care. | ✅ Yes, for specialists | ❌ No (except emergency) |
| 🟧 **PPO** (Preferred Provider Organization) | Flexible. No need for referrals. Higher cost for out-of-network care. | ❌ No | ✅ Yes, at higher cost |
| 🟨 **POS** (Point of Service) | Hybrid of HMO & PPO. Requires PCP and referrals, but offers some out-of-network coverage. | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes, with higher cost |
| 🟪 **EPO** (Exclusive Provider Organization) | Like an HMO, but **no referrals required**. Still **no out-of-network** coverage (except emergencies). | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> 🧠 Pharmacy Tip: Always check insurance card or PBM portal for plan type and coverage rules.

### Public Health Insurance

The ***Social Security Act Amendments (1965)*** created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

| Part | Nickname | 📝 What It Covers | 💰 Costs | 💊 Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 🅰️   | Hospital Insurance | Inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing, hospice, home health | Usually "free" if worked 10+ years (payroll taxes) | Deductibles & coinsurance apply |
| 🅱️   | Medical Insurance  | Doctor visits, outpatient services, preventive care, DME | Monthly premium, deductible, 20% coinsurance | Optional; penalty if you delay enrollment |
| 🅲   | Medicare Advantage | Combines A & B (and usually D), run by private insurers | Varies by plan | May offer dental, vision, hearing, gym |
| 🅳   | Prescription Drug | Outpatient prescription drugs | Monthly premium, deductible, copays | Private plans available; penalty for late enrollment; Established by the MMA (2003) |

#### 🍩 Medicare Part D “Donut Hole” (Coverage Gap)

The “donut hole” is a temporary limit on what Medicare Part D will pay for prescription drugs.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ **Deductible Phase** | You pay 100% until your deductible is met (if plan has one).                                                                    |
| 💸 **Initial Coverage** | You pay a **copay/coinsurance**; plan pays the rest. Ends when total drug costs (you + plan) hit a threshold (e.g., \~\$5,030). |
| 🍩 **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")** | You pay **25% of drug costs** (brand & generic). |
| 💯 **Catastrophic Coverage** | After your out-of-pocket costs hit the cap (\~\$8,000), you pay **nothing** or a small coinsurance per prescription. |

> 💊 For techs: Patients in the donut hole may suddenly pay more—watch for confusion or frustration and refer to the pharmacist.

#### 🏥 Medi-Cal (California Medicaid)

Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program, providing free or low-cost health coverage for:

- Low-income families and individuals
- Seniors (65+)
- People with disabilities
- Certain adults under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

It covers a wide range of services like doctor visits, hospital care, mental health, vision, dental, and prescriptions.

> 💊 Pharmacy Tech Tip: Medi-Cal often uses a state drug formulary and may require Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) for some meds.

#### 🩺 Medi-Medi (Dual Eligibility)

A “Medi-Medi” patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal.

Medicare is the primary payer; Medi-Cal acts as secondary, covering:

- Co-pays
- Deductibles
- Coinsurance
- These patients often qualify for extra help with Part D prescription drug costs.

> 🧠 Watch for “Medi-Medi” flags in patient profiles. These patients usually have no out-of-pocket cost for covered meds and medical care.

#### Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)

The **MMA** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Mangement (MTM)** Services.
