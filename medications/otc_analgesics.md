# 📘 Considerations for OTC Analgesics

Analgesics are medications used to relieve pain. They may be:

- **Systemic (e.g., oral tablets)**: affect the whole body
- **Topical**: act locally but may still have systemic absorption and therefore produce whole-body effects

They're commonly used to treat:

- Pain
- Inflammation
- Fever
- Menstrual cramps
- Musculoskeletal injuries
- Osteoarthritis
- Headaches

There are 3 main categories of these medications:

## Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

| 🔬 Common Examples | Ibuprofen, Naproxen |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |

**Mechanism**: NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins also protect the stomach lining and support kidney function — so side effects can be serious.

**Common Uses**: Headaches, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, toothaches, fever, and injuries.

**Risks**:

- GI irritation: heartburn, nausea, ulcers, bleeding
- Kidney impairment (especially in dehydrated or elderly patients)
- Cardiovascular risk (avoid in heart disease)
- Risk of serious complications if combined with alcohol

> ⚠️ Avoid NSAIDs in pregnant women, patients with kidney disease, GI disorders, or heart conditions.

## Salicylates

| 🔬 Common Examples | Aspirin, Magnesium Salicylate |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |

**Mechanism**: Like NSAIDs, salicylates reduce pain, inflammation, and fever, and also inhibit blood clot formation — making them useful for preventing heart attacks and strokes in high-risk patients.

**Common Uses**: Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, cardiovascular prevention (low-dose aspirin)

**Risks**:

- Increased bleeding risk
- GI irritation, nausea, indigestion, vomiting
- Kidney strain
- **Reye's Syndrome**: rare but serious condition in children with viral infections. Do not give aspirin to children or teens with viral symptoms

> ⚠️ Avoid in pregnancy, bleeding disorders, and patients with ulcers. Also avoid alcohol.

## Acetaminophen (APAP)

| 🔬 Other/ Alternative Name | Paracetamol |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |

> ⚠️ There are over 600 drugs on the market that contain APAP, making it one of the most readily accessible medications on the market. Because of this, patients may not realize they are taking multiple products containing APAP and risk the chance for overdose.

**Mechanism**: Acetaminophen relieves pain and reduces fever. Unlike NSAIDs, it does not reduce inflammation and does not irritate the stomach.

**Uses**: Headaches, fever, mild pain, safe in pregnancy and those with GI issues.

**Risks**:

- **Liver toxicity** especially with high doses or chronic alcohol use
- Avoid combining with other medications that contain APAP (e.g., cold/flu combo meds)

> ⚠️ Max adult dose: 4,000 mg per day; less for patients with liver disease or heavy alcohol use.

| Generic Name | Common Brand names that contain the specified analgesic |
|--|--|
| Ibuprofen | Advil, Motrin, Midol |
| Naproxen | Aleve, Midol, Pamprin |
| Aspirin | Aspirin, Bufferin, Exotrin, Pamprin, St. Joseph, Halfprin |
| Acetaminophen (APAP) | Tylenol, Midol, Pamprin |

## 🧴 Topical Analgesics

Topical analgesics are applied directly to the skin to relieve minor aches and pains from musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, strains, and bruises.

These products are commonly used for short-term relief of localized pain and are for external use only.

| Ingredient | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| **Camphor** | Cooling effect; can be toxic if ingested (especially to children) |
| **Menthol** | Provides a cooling sensation and mild pain relief |
| **Methyl Nicotinate** | Increases blood flow to area; warming effect |
| **Capsaicin** | Derived from chili peppers; causes warmth and desensitizes pain receptors over time |
| **Methyl Salicylate** | Produces a warming effect; salicylate derivative (avoid in children with viral illness) |
| **Trolamine Salicylate** | Similar to aspirin; absorbed through the skin for anti-inflammatory effect |

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings

- For external use only — never apply to broken skin, mucous membranes, or near the eyes.
- Do not bandage tightly or use with heating pads, as this can increase absorption and cause burns.
- Camphor is highly toxic if swallowed, especially in children — even small amounts can cause seizures or death.
- Avoid using multiple topical products together unless advised by a healthcare provider.

> 🧒 Keep out of reach of children. Always wash hands after application, especially before eating or touching the face.
