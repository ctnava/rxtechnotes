# 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. They usually contain inactive or weakened parts of a pathogen, or a genetic blueprint that prompts an immune response. Under normal ciscumstances, the **Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** publishes revised adult immunization schedules annually.

> **Herd Immunity** is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune. This is crucial to protecting **public health** by making it harder for pathogens to spread to those who are not vaccinated (like babies or the immunocompromised).

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is responsible for:

- Advising the CDC on national immunization policy
- Advising the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** on research priorities related to vaccines
- Establishing the vaccine antigen components for manufacturers
- Determining the legitimacy of any legal claims related to vaccines

## 📋 Common Vaccines

| Vaccine | Pathogen(s) | Frequency | Indications | Required in Healthcare? |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Flu** | Influenza (Multiple Strains) | Annual | All patients over 6 months or status unknown (regardless of health) | ✅ Yes (required during flu season) |
| **COVID-19** | SARS-CoV-2 | Annual or updated booster as recommended | Adults & Children | ✅ Yes (often required) |
| **MMR** | Measles, Mumps, Rubella | 2 doses (childhood); 1 booster for travel | Required for school; travel to endemic areas | ✅ Yes (2 documented doses or positive titer) |
| **Tdap** | Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis | Every 10 years (booster); during pregnancy | Adults every 10 years; pregnancy; wound care | ✅ Yes (1-time dose + boosters) |
| **Hepatitis B** | Hepatitis B virus | 2–3 dose series | Healthcare workers; infants; high-risk adults | ✅ Yes (OSHA-mandated) |
| **HPV** | Human papillomavirus | 2–3 doses depending on age | Preteens (ages 11–12); adults up to age 26 | ❌ No |
| **Varicella** | Varicella-zoster virus | 2 doses | Those without prior infection; school entry | ✅ Yes (or documented immunity) |
| **Meningococcal** | Neisseria meningitidis | 1–2 doses (some require boosters) | Teens; college students; military recruits | ⚠️ Conditional (recommended for lab workers) |

> 📌 **Note**: Vaccination schedules vary by age, health status, and exposure risk. Always consult the CDC immunization schedule.

In the U.S., there is an effective reminder system for childhood vaccinations, but adult immunizations are often overlooked due to the lack of consistent tracking or reminders. As of 2011, the pneumococcal vaccination rate was **62% for elderly adults** and only **20% for younger adults**.

Pharmacy technicians support immunization efforts by:

- ⚠️ **Identifying patients** eligible for recommended vaccines
- 🔢 **Entering vaccine prescriptions** and processing billing claims (especially through **Medicare Part D** and private insurers)
- 📄 Providing **CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS)** and collecting signed consent forms
- 🧊 Ensuring **cold chain compliance** by monitoring storage temperatures and logging refrigeration
- 📆 Assisting with **vaccine recordkeeping** and **appointment scheduling**

> ⚠️ **Tech Vaccine Authority**: In many states, technicians may administer certain vaccines after completing approved training programs and certification, per state board rules and under **HHS guidance** (especially during public health emergencies).

## 🧪 Immunization Initiatives in Retail

💬 **Patient Conversations & Screening**

As the first point of contact in a pharmacy, technicians should be alert for opportunities to educate and screen patients. Start simple:

"**Have you had your flu shot this year?**"

> 🤧 Some patients believe the flu vaccine causes illness. You can clarify that protection takes ~2 weeks to develop and the vaccine itself doesn't cause the flu.

Use patient cues to suggest vaccine needs:

| Cue | Suggestion |
|-----|------------|
| 🍼 Buying baby supplies or mentions of pregnancy | Recommend **Tdap** and **flu** for pregnant individuals and close contacts. Pertussis and flu can be dangerous to newborns. |
| ✈️ Travel plans or purchase of motion sickness meds (e.g., Dramamine) | Suggest **Hepatitis A** vaccine—second only to travelers’ diarrhea for travel-related illness. |
| 🤧 Persistent cough or "whooping" sound | Raise the possibility of **pertussis** exposure; refer to pharmacist for evaluation. |
| 💉 Diabetic supply purchases | Screen for **flu**, **pneumococcal**, **Hepatitis B**, and **Tdap** vaccines. Diabetics are at higher risk for complications. |

> 💡 **Tip**: The **Immunization Action Coalition** (immunize.org) provides free tools for adult vaccine screening that pharmacy staff can use during patient intake.

## 🧪 Immunization Initiatives in Hospitals

The **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** monitor hospital immunization practices, especially for **influenza** and **pneumococcal** vaccines. Hospitals that do not meet vaccination benchmarks may face **reduced reimbursement**.

### 📋 Best Practices

Ideally, **influenza vaccination should be a standing order** for all admitted patients. If a patient refuses or has a temporary contraindication, they should be **reassessed later during their hospital stay**.

Key practices include:

- 💉 **Inactivated flu vaccines** should be easily accessible and properly stored throughout the hospital.
- 👩‍⚕️ Any qualified healthcare professional should be allowed to administer the flu vaccine when a patient meets eligibility criteria.
- 📤 **Flu vaccination should also be a standing discharge order** for all patients—regardless of their inpatient diagnosis.

**Pharmacy technicians** play a vital role in hospital immunization initiatives:

- 🧾 Check vaccine status during medication reconciliation or intake
- ⚠️ **Alert the pharmacist** when a high-risk patient is identified
- 🧊 Ensure proper vaccine storage conditions are maintained
- 📄 Assist in documenting vaccine refusals or contraindications

> ✅ Encouraging vaccination at every point of care helps reduce readmissions, improve outcomes, and support hospital reimbursement goals.

## 🚨 High-Priority Patients

Patients with serious or chronic health conditions are at the **highest risk for flu and pneumonia complications**:

- **Diabetes**
- **Congestive heart failure** or other heart disease
- **Chronic kidney** or **liver disease**
- **Chronic lung disease** (especially asthma)
- **Immunocompromised patients** (due to illness or medication)
- **Tobacco smokers**

These patients should also be immunized against **pneumococcal disease**.

> 🧠 Patients with heart disease are **100× more likely** to require ICU care for pneumococcal infections.

The **Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)** recommends pneumococcal vaccination for **all adults age 65 and older** and for younger adults with certain medical conditions.

## ⚠️ Vaccine Errors

Vaccine administration errors can pose serious safety risks and may lead to under-immunization, adverse effects, or loss of reimbursement. Technicians play a key role in preventing these errors by recognizing the most common causes:

- **Unclear or Unapproved Abbreviations**
  - Do **not** use vaccine abbreviations unless they are listed on the **CDC’s approved abbreviation list**.
  - ✅ This list should be **clearly posted** and accessible within the pharmacy.
- **Look-Alike / Sound-Alike Products**
  - ⚠️ *Tdap* (for **patients age 7 and older**) vs. *DTaP* (for **children under 7**).
  - Always verify **patient age** before selecting the correct product.
- **Confusing Brand Names**
  - Many vaccine brand names share similar endings, even when they treat different diseases:
    - **GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)** vaccines often end in **“-rix”** *(e.g., Shingrix, Infanrix, Engerix)*
    - **Merck** vaccines often end in **“-vax”** *(e.g., Varivax, Zostavax)*
      - ⚠️ **Zostavax** is **not approved for children** (do not confuse it with Varivax.)
- **Prescribing, Transcription, or Dispensing Errors**
  - Giving the **wrong dose** based on **patient age or weight**.
  - Failing to use the **correct formulation** for pediatric vs. adult patients.
  - Dispensing the wrong product due to similar packaging.

Vaccine safety starts with accurate communication and careful attention to detail—especially when working with similar-sounding products. Pharmacy technicians should:

- 📅 Always **verify patient age and weight** before processing a vaccine.
- 📦 **Check the package insert** every time a vaccine is dispensed to confirm proper:
  - Indication
  - Age range
  - Route and site of administration
- 💉 Use **unit-of-use syringes** when available to reduce the risk of dosing or labeling errors.

## ❄️Vaccine Storage and Handling

Proper storage and handling of vaccines is **essential** to maintaining their safety and effectiveness. Vaccines that are exposed to incorrect temperatures may lose potency—even if they appear unchanged.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Vaccines that have been improperly stored **do not change color, smell, or appearance.** Visual inspection is not enough to confirm potency.

- **Immediately refrigerate or freeze** vaccines upon delivery, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
- Verify the **cold chain** was maintained during shipping (check temperature indicators or data loggers).
- Ensure vaccines are stored in:
  - A **dedicated medical-grade refrigerator or freezer** (not a household dorm fridge).
  - Clearly **labeled bins or baskets** to separate types and reduce mix-ups.
  - The **middle of the unit** (not in the door or directly against the back wall).
- **Log temperatures twice daily** using a calibrated thermometer or digital data logger.
- **Do not administer** any vaccine that may have been exposed to:
  - Incorrect temperatures
  - Light damage (for light-sensitive vaccines)
  - Expired storage conditions
  - Physical contamination

💡 **Tips for Safe Vaccine Storage**

- Always **check expiration dates** before storing or dispensing.
- Rotate stock: **"First In, First Out" (FIFO)** method.
- Post a **vaccine storage chart** (e.g., CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit) near the fridge.
- Maintain an **emergency plan** for power outages or equipment failure.
