## Shared Duties

### Medication Safety

Preventing medication errors is an important goal of every pharmacy and, therefore, pharmacy technicians play an important role in preventing medication errors.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.

### Communication

Communication is an important part of teamwork in any pharmacy. It can take place in written, verbal, or nonverbal forms. As a technician, you may be communicating with patients, their representatives, as well as other healthcare professionals. The clarity, tone, and professionalism of your communication can directly affect patient safety and workflow efficiency.

## Services Offered

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

A process to ensure the most accurate, complete list of all medications a patient is taking—name, dose, route, and frequency—by comparing current medical records with patient and provider sources.  

Especially critical for:

- Emergency Department admissions
- Hospitalist-managed patients
- Patients with **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
- Transfers from **Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**

### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> 📍 MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🛡️ HIPAA Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.

#### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. Herd Immunity is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune; which is critical for the protection of public health.

To support public health through vaccine efforts, pharmacies offer immunization services.
