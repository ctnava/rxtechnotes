# Chapter 3: Legal Access to Marketed Drugs

This chapter covers how patients are authorized access to medications by prescribing authorities.

## The Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951)

The Durham-Humphrey Amendment amendment established two classes of drugs: *legend* & *over-the-counter* (OTC).

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
- **Legend**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription".
- **Over-the-Counter(OTC)**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use.

### ⚠️ Hidden Dangers of OTC Drugs

**Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are not inherently safe** just because they don’t require a prescription. Many OTC medications can cause significant drug interactions, adverse effects, or even life-threatening complications; especially when combined with prescription drugs or taken incorrectly.

When performing **medication reconciliation** (the process of gathering a patient’s full medication history), pharmacy technicians must:

- **Ask about all OTC medications**, supplements, and herbal products
- **Document** them in the patient’s profile
- **Refer patients to the pharmacist** for counseling if any concerns arise

#### 💊 Analgesics (Pain Relievers)

Analgesics are medications used to relieve pain. They may be:

- **Systemic (e.g., oral tablets)**: affect the whole body
- **Topical**: act locally but may still have systemic absorption and therefore produce whole-body effects

They're commonly used to treat:

- Pain
- Inflammation
- Fever
- Menstrual cramps
- Musculoskeletal injuries
- Osteoarthritis
- Headaches

There are 3 main categories of these medications:

##### Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

| 🔬 Common Examples | Ibuprofen, Naproxen |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |

**Mechanism**: NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins also protect the stomach lining and support kidney function — so side effects can be serious.

**Common Uses**: Headaches, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, toothaches, fever, and injuries.

**Risks**:

- GI irritation: heartburn, nausea, ulcers, bleeding
- Kidney impairment (especially in dehydrated or elderly patients)
- Cardiovascular risk (avoid in heart disease)
- Risk of serious complications if combined with alcohol

> ⚠️ Avoid NSAIDs in pregnant women, patients with kidney disease, GI disorders, or heart conditions.

##### Salicylates

| 🔬 Common Examples | Aspirin, Magnesium Salicylate |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |

**Mechanism**: Like NSAIDs, salicylates reduce pain, inflammation, and fever, and also inhibit blood clot formation — making them useful for preventing heart attacks and strokes in high-risk patients.

**Common Uses**: Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, cardiovascular prevention (low-dose aspirin)

**Risks**:

- Increased bleeding risk
- GI irritation, nausea, indigestion, vomiting
- Kidney strain
- **Reye's Syndrome**: rare but serious condition in children with viral infections. Do not give aspirin to children or teens with viral symptoms

> ⚠️ Avoid in pregnancy, bleeding disorders, and patients with ulcers. Also avoid alcohol.

##### Acetaminophen (APAP)

| 🔬 Other/ Alternative Name | Paracetamol |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |

> ⚠️ There are over 600 drugs on the market that contain APAP, making it one of the most readily accessible medications on the market. Because of this, patients may not realize they are taking multiple products containing APAP and risk the chance for overdose.

**Mechanism**: Acetaminophen relieves pain and reduces fever. Unlike NSAIDs, it does not reduce inflammation and does not irritate the stomach.

**Uses**: Headaches, fever, mild pain, safe in pregnancy and those with GI issues.

**Risks**:

- **Liver toxicity** especially with high doses or chronic alcohol use
- Avoid combining with other medications that contain APAP (e.g., cold/flu combo meds)

> ⚠️ Max adult dose: 4,000 mg per day; less for patients with liver disease or heavy alcohol use.

| Generic Name | Common Brand names that contain the specified analgesic |
|--|--|
| Ibuprofen | Advil, Motrin, Midol |
| Naproxen | Aleve, Midol, Pamprin |
| Aspirin | Aspirin, Bufferin, Exotrin, Pamprin, St. Joseph, Halfprin |
| Acetaminophen (APAP) | Tylenol, Midol, Pamprin |

##### 🧴 Topical Analgesics

Topical analgesics are applied directly to the skin to relieve minor aches and pains from musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, strains, and bruises.

These products are commonly used for short-term relief of localized pain and are for external use only.

| Ingredient | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| **Camphor** | Cooling effect; can be toxic if ingested (especially to children) |
| **Menthol** | Provides a cooling sensation and mild pain relief |
| **Methyl Nicotinate** | Increases blood flow to area; warming effect |
| **Capsaicin** | Derived from chili peppers; causes warmth and desensitizes pain receptors over time |
| **Methyl Salicylate** | Produces a warming effect; salicylate derivative (avoid in children with viral illness) |
| **Trolamine Salicylate** | Similar to aspirin; absorbed through the skin for anti-inflammatory effect |

###### ⚠️ Safety Warnings

- For external use only — never apply to broken skin, mucous membranes, or near the eyes.
- Do not bandage tightly or use with heating pads, as this can increase absorption and cause burns.
- Camphor is highly toxic if swallowed, especially in children — even small amounts can cause seizures or death.
- Avoid using multiple topical products together unless advised by a healthcare provider.

> 🧒 Keep out of reach of children. Always wash hands after application, especially before eating or touching the face.

## 🔒 Controlled & Monitored Substances

The ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 1970)*** classifies five levels of controlled substances that have potential for abuse and therefore restricts their distribution. These five categories are called "schedules" and are determined based on potential for abuse, medical use, and risk to overall safety. Drugs placed in Schedules I–V are controlled substances and are subject to varying degrees of regulation regarding prescribing, dispensing, and recordkeeping.

> **TRIVIA**: The Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990 added anabolic steroids (like testosterone) to Schedule III of the CSA.

| Schedule | Mark | 🧾 Description | 💊 Examples | 🔁 Refill Restrictions |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 🟥 I      | C-I  | 🚫 No accepted medical use, 🆙 high abuse potential | Heroin, LSD, Ecstasy (MDMA), Cannabis* | ❌ **Not allowed** — Cannot be prescribed |
| 🟥 II     | C-II | ✅ Accepted medical use, 🆙 high abuse risk, severe dependence | Oxycodone (opioid), Methadone (opioid), Fentanyl (opioid), Adderall (most stimulants) | ⛔ **No refills allowed** — New Rx required each time. |
| 🟧 III    | C-III| ⚠️ Moderate to low physical/psychological dependence potential | Tylenol with Codeine (opioid combo), Ketamine (anesthetic), Testosterone (anabolic steroid) | 🔁 Up to **5 refills** in **6 months**                          |
| 🟨 IV     | C-IV | 🟡 Low abuse potential and dependence risk | Alprazolam (Xanax), Diazepam (Valium), Zolpidem (Ambien), Tramadol (most benzodiazepines, some sleep aids & analgesics) | 🔁 Up to **5 refills** in **6 months** |
| 🟩 V      | C-V  | 🟢 Lowest abuse potential, small amounts of narcotics | Robitussin AC (codeine cough syrup), Lomotil (diarrhea), Lyrica (pregabalin) | 🔁 Up to **5 refills** in **6 months**  |

\*Cannabis remains Schedule I federally, though legal or decriminalized in many U.S. states.

### 💼 Prescriber & Pharmacy Responsibilities

- A **valid DEA number** is required on all prescriptions for controlled substances.
- Schedule II prescriptions must be written (or e-prescribed where required) and cannot be refilled.
- Partial fills of C-II prescriptions are allowed if requested by the prescriber or patient:
  - The initial partial fill must occur within 30 days of the issue date.
  - The remainder must be filled within that same 30-day window; otherwise, the prescription expires.
- Schedule II records must be stored separately from all others.
- Schedule III–V records must also be maintained separately and be readily retrievable.

### 🗃️ Recordkeeping Requirements (CA Laws Referenced)

- All prescription and dispensing records for controlled substances must be stored on-site for at least 3 years (CA B&P Code § 4333).
- Inventory audits must be conducted every 2 years (CA H&S Code § 11190) and must include:
  - Drug name, dosage form, and strength
  - Quantity on hand
  - Date and time of inventory
  - Signature of the responsible pharmacist

### 📝 DEA Forms & Compliance

- **DEA Form 222** is required for ordering Schedule II drugs via CSOS.
- **DEA Form 41** is used for returning drugs to suppliers or for reverse distribution (destruction).
- **DEA Form 106** must be filed within **one business day** of discovering theft or significant loss.
  - **The California Board of Pharmacy** must also be notified within **30 days**.

### ⚠️ Dispensing & Monitoring Duties

- Schedule II prescriptions generally require a written or e-prescription, except in emergencies:
  - A verbal or faxed order may be accepted temporarily, but a written/electronic Rx must follow within 7 days.
- Pharmacies must maintain dispensing logs for all refills and ensure proper dispensing and recordkeeping.

It is the pharmacy staff’s responsibility to:

- Verify and log all controlled substance prescriptions
- Monitor for abuse or diversion
- Ensure compliance with all state and federal regulations

### 🧪 Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA, 2005)

The CMEA was enacted to combat the illegal production of methamphetamine by creating a list of monitored drugs, equipment, and chemicals while also placing ***strict, time based controls on over-the-counter (OTC)*** sales of:

- **Pseudoephedrine**
- **Ephedrine**
- **Phenylpropanolamine**

| Time Period | Maximum Amount | Notes |
| ------------|----------------|-------|
| **Per Day**              | **3.6 grams**  | Applies to **all sources** (combined)    |
| **30 Days (in-person)**  | **9 grams**    | Applies to retail pharmacy purchases     |
| **30 Days (mail-order)** | **7.5 grams**  | Stricter limit for mobile/online vendors |

These ingredients are commonly found in cold and allergy medications but can also be used in the **illicit manufacture of methamphetamine**.

🔐 **Storage & Access Requirements**:

- Must be kept Behind-the-Counter or in a locked cabinet.
- not available for self-service.
- **Cannot be sold through drive-thru windows**, due to ID and logbook requirements.

🧾 **Sales & Logbook Requirements**:

- Purchasers must be 18 years or older and present a valid photo ID.
- A logbook must be maintained that records:
  - Purchaser’s name and address
  - Product name
  - Quantity sold
  - Date and time of the sale

## Medication Orders & Prescriptions

Prescriptions and medication orders are instructions from a medical practictioner that authorizes the issue of a drug or device to a patient. They have the following requirements:

- **Prescriber Information**: the name, title, office address, and telephone number
- **National Provider Identifier (NPI)**: A prescriber's unique national identification number, mandated by HIPAA and administered by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)
- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: A number assigned to the prescriber by the DEA that is required on all controlled substance prescriptions
- **Date**: when the prescription was written
- **Patient Identifiers**: information used to identify the patient
  - **required**: name & address
  - **optional**: date of birth & weight (for pediatrics)
- **Inscription**: specifies the medication prescribed, including strength & amount
- **Signa**: directions for use
- **Refill Instructions**: How many refills are authorized for the patient
- **Product Selection Code (Optional)**: Whether or not the medication is specified to be dispensed as written
- **Prescriber Signature**: required on all prescriptions

### Translating the Signa

Signa (the "sig") is almost always heavily abbreviated and pharmacy techs are often required to transcribe them for computer entry. Below are a list of common abbreviations used for transcribing SIGs on prescriptions or medication orders.
