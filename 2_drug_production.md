## How Drugs are Manufactured

**The Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FDC)** was passed in 1906 to prohibit interstate commerce in adulterated or misbranded food, drinks, and drugs on top of requiring government preapproval before marketing or sale; enforced by the Bureau of Chemistry. It enforced these regulations until the Food, Drug, & Insecticide Administration was formed in 1927 and rebranded as the FDA in 1930.

The **FDCA** (1938) was passed in response to a fatal poisoning of over 100 people by an untested ***sulfanilamide*** drug. This law requires that any new drugs ***must be proven safe*** if used according to directions on its label. Later in 1962, a new sleeping pill containing the drug ***thalidomide*** caused severe birth defects in pregnant women. In response, the **Kefauver-Harris Amendment** required that all new drugs ***must also be proven effective*** for the intended use required on drug labels in accordance with the ruling on the *Alberty Food Products v. US* case in 1950.

> **Note**: Thalidomide was later found to be safe and effective for treating multiple myeloma & leprosy and is now approved for those uses. However, men and women must both acknowledge the risks associated with taking it and actions they must take while being treated with it.

### Drug Production

There exist two commercial categories of drugs: brand name and generic.

- **Brand Name Drugs**: Original drugs developed by pharmaceutical companies, protected by patents, and marketed under a brand name.
- **Generic Drugs**: Copies of brand-name drugs that have the same active ingredients, strength, dosage form, and route of administration, but sold under generic chemical names or different brand names after the original patent expires.

#### Brand Name Drug Development

In order for a newly patented, *Brand Name* drug to come to market, the FDA must first approve it. The process generally is as follows:

##### Step 1: Research & Development (3-6 Years)

Drug development begins with identification for a target for a drug to act on. Compounds are screened in laboratory tests for specificity & activity on these targets. A cohort of suitable candidates (~25%) are selected for use in preclinical testing.

##### Step 2: Preclinical Testing (1 Year)

Safety & efficacy are evaluated before clinical trials. This is first done *in vitro* with human cells to assess efficacy & toxicity before *in vivo* studies are done with live animals to observe the effects the drugs have on Absorption, Distributive, Metabolic, & Elimination (ADME) processes. At least two mammalian species must be tested before they are allowed to proceed to humans.

Results of these trials must be filed with the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to file an application for a ***Investigational New Drug (IND)***. This application additionally requires a plan for human testing and manufacturing details to comply with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) provisioned by the Kefauver-Harris Amendment.

##### Step 3: Clinical Trials (4-7 Years)

Clinical trials involve human research subjects, with "informed consent" and the information necessary to provide it required by the The Kefauver-Harris Amendment for participation. These trials are done in 3 phases, each involving more people as they progress. Participants are free to leave as they wish.

###### Phase 1 (20 - 80 People)

Determine ***safety*** first by collecting a profile of side effects in a small group of healthy volunteers over ***several months***.

###### Phase 2 (100-300 People)

Determine ***efficacy*** by testing it on a group of patients with the condition that the drug is trying to treat while also staying on the look out for side effects for ***several months to 2 years***. Controlled trials are also used to compare the drug's activity against a placebo. This test is double-blind, meaning that neither the patients nor the prescribers are aware that the drug is a placebo.

###### Phase 3 (1,000 - 3,000 People)

Confirm ***efficacy*** while collecting ***additional safety*** data in a larger population. Also gathering data on interactions and effects at different ***dosages*** for ***1 to 4 years***.

##### Step 4: Review & Approval (1-2 Years)

A ***New Drug Application (NDA)*** can be filed and the FDA can either approve the drug for marketing (regulated by the Kefauver-Harris Amendment) or request further testing.

##### Step 5: Post-Market Surveillance (Ongoing)

There is ongoing monitoring program for long-term safety & efficacy after the drug is released to the market while the original manufacturer enjoys exclusive production rights without competition for a period of ~20 years to offset cost.

#### Generic Drug Manufacturing

Once a patent for a brand name drug expires, other manufacturers may copy the drug and release it under its generic name. Despite the fact that generic drugs are copies of brand name drugs, licensed manufacturers must still be approved to produce them. However, there is no need for preclinical or normal clinical trials for safety & efficacy as they were already established by the original producer which brings down approval time to 1 to 3 years.

##### Step 1: Bioequivalence Studies

During this process, the manufacturer must prove that their drug is both pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent because their inactive ingredients have been altered.

- **Pharmaceutically Equivalent Drugs** contain identical amounts of the same active ingredients in the same dosage form.
- **Therapeutically Equivalent Drugs** produce effects in patients that are identical to their brand name counterparts.

Studies are conducted on a small group of healthy volunteers to compare the generic and brand-name drug's effects on ADME processes. After which, the manufacturer submits an **Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)** to the FDA.

##### Step 2: Manufacturing & Quality Assurance

The FDA checks for trademark violations. Packaging and labeling must be distinct from brand name. Inactive ingredients may vary to lower production cost, but a facility inspection is also conducted to ensure compliance with the aforementioned Good Manufacturing Practices

##### Step 3: Post-Market Surveillance

If the ANDA meets FDA requirements, the generic drug is approved for marketing. Generic drugs are also subject to the same post-market safety monitoring as brand name drugs.
