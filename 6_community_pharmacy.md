# Chapter 6: Community Pharmacy

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

## Types of Community Pharmacies

- **Independent Pharmacies**: Individually owned and operated, often serving local communities with personalized service.
- **Chain Pharmacies**: National or regional pharmacy chains such as CVS or Walgreens.
- **Mass Merchandiser Pharmacies**: Large retail chains like Walmart, Target, or Costco that have in-store pharmacies.
- **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

## Interpersonal Activities

Strong communication skills are essential in community pharmacy settings.

- Listen actively and make eye contact
- Repeat the customer's concerns to confirm understanding
- Use a positive, respectful tone
- Refer to the patient by name
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone
- Follow facility procedures
- Refer clinical questions or concerns to the pharmacist

### At the Counter

Pharmacy technicians:

- Receive and enter prescriptions accurately
- Verify insurance and assist with billing issues
- Retrieve and ring up prescriptions
- Direct patients to the pharmacist for required counseling
- Manage front-end sales for pharmacy-related items

## Services Offered

### Walk-In Clinics

Some pharmacy locations operate on-site clinics staffed by **nurse practitioners (NPs)** or **physician assistants (PAs)**. Examples include:

- **CVS MinuteClinic**
- **Walgreens Healthcare Clinic**

These clinics provide minor acute care services such as infection treatment, injury care, health screenings, and immunizations. Technicians help with patient intake, record keeping, and coordinating follow-up.

#### 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. They usually contain inactive or weakened parts of a pathogen, or a genetic blueprint that prompts an immune response.

> **Herd Immunity** is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune. This is crucial to protecting **public health** by making it harder for pathogens to spread to those who are not vaccinated (like babies or the immunocompromised).

##### 📋 Common Vaccines & Their Details

| Vaccine | Pathogen(s) | Frequency | Indications |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Flu** | Influenza A/B | Annual | All adults; high-risk populations (elderly, immunocompromised, healthcare workers) |
| **COVID-19** | SARS-CoV-2 | Annual or updated booster as recommended | Adults and children per CDC guidance |
| **MMR** | Measles, Mumps, Rubella | 2 doses (childhood); 1 booster for travel | Required for school; travel to endemic areas |
| **Tdap** | Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis | Every 10 years (booster); during pregnancy | Adults every 10 years; pregnancy; wound care |
| **Hepatitis B** | Hepatitis B virus | 2–3 dose series | Healthcare workers; infants; high-risk adults |
| **HPV** | Human papillomavirus | 2–3 doses depending on age | Preteens (ages 11–12); adults up to age 26 |
| **Varicella** | Varicella-zoster virus | 2 doses | Those without prior infection; school entry |
| **Meningococcal** | Neisseria meningitidis | 1–2 doses (some require boosters) | Teens; college students; military recruits |

> 📌 **Note**: Vaccination schedules vary by age, health status, and exposure risk. Always consult the CDC immunization schedule.

##### 🧪 Pharmacy Technician Responsibilities

Pharmacy technicians support immunization efforts by:

- 🔢 Entering vaccine prescriptions and billing claims (especially Medicare Part D or private insurance)
- 📄 Providing **CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS)** and obtaining consent forms
- 🧊 Verifying cold chain compliance (refrigeration and storage logs)
- 📆 Assisting with vaccine recordkeeping and appointment scheduling

> ⚠️ **Tech Vaccine Authority**: In many states, technicians may administer certain vaccines after completing approved training programs and certification, per state board rules and under **HHS guidance** (especially during public health emergencies).

### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### Requirements Set Forth by Law

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

#### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

#### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🔐 **HIPAA (1996)**: Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.
