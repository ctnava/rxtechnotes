# Chapter 6: Community Pharmacy

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

- **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### Requirements Set Forth by Law

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

#### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

#### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🔐 **HIPAA (1996)**: Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.
