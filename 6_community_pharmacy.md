# Chapter 6: Community Pharmacy

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

## Types of Community Pharmacies

- **Independent Pharmacies**: Individually owned and operated, often serving local communities with personalized service.
- **Chain Pharmacies**: National or regional pharmacy chains such as CVS or Walgreens.
- **Mass Merchandiser Pharmacies**: Large retail chains like Walmart, KMart, or Costco that have in-store pharmacies.
- **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

## Services Offered

### Walk-In Clinics

Some pharmacy locations operate on-site clinics staffed by **nurse practitioners (NPs)** or **physician assistants (PAs)**. Examples include:

- **CVS MinuteClinic**
- **Walgreens Healthcare Clinic**

These clinics provide minor acute care services such as infection treatment, injury care, health screenings, and immunizations. Technicians help with patient intake, record keeping, and coordinating follow-up.

> **State Scope-of-Practice Laws**: Determine whether technicians may assist in clinic-related activities or administer vaccines under pharmacist supervision.

### Vaccines

Pharmacy technicians support vaccination programs by:

- Entering prescription and billing information
- Providing the **CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)** and consent forms
- Verifying cold chain compliance for vaccine storage
- Assisting with recordkeeping and scheduling

> In many states, **pharmacy technicians are permitted to administer vaccines** after completing a certified training program, per state board regulations and HHS guidance during public health emergencies.

### Requirements Set Forth by Law

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

#### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The ***Omnibus Budget Reconcillation Act (OBRA-90 or "the Omnibus", 1990)*** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
- ⛔ **Document Refusals of Counsel**: Rejections of counsel must be signed and stored as part of the patient's medication profile.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

#### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The ***Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)*** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide ***Medication Therapy Mangement (MTM)*** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**:Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

### Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996)**: Requires all patient health data to be kept confidential. Pharmacy staff must protect patient privacy during all DSM and MTM services.

## Interpersonal Activities

Strong communication skills are essential in community pharmacy settings.

- Listen actively and make eye contact
- Repeat the customer's concerns to confirm understanding
- Use a positive, respectful tone
- Refer to the patient by name
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone
- Follow facility procedures
- Refer clinical questions or concerns to the pharmacist

> **OBRA '90 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990)**: Requires pharmacists to offer counseling to Medicaid patients receiving new prescriptions. Technicians must inform patients of this offer but may not provide the counseling themselves.

### At the Counter

Pharmacy technicians:

- Receive and enter prescriptions accurately
- Verify insurance and assist with billing issues
- Retrieve and ring up prescriptions
- Direct patients to the pharmacist for required counseling
- Manage front-end sales for pharmacy-related items

> **Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA, 2005)**: Requires that pseudoephedrine-containing products be sold only in person, not through drive-thru. Purchasers must present ID, sign a logbook, and stay within purchase limits.

### On the Phone

Pharmacy technicians may:

- Answer general questions about prescription status or store services
- Take refill requests from patients or automated systems
- Contact prescribers for refill authorizations or clarification
- Relay messages to the pharmacist
- Maintain a professional and courteous tone at all times

> All phone conversations involving patient information are subject to **HIPAA** privacy standards.
