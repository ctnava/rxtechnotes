## Health Insurance

### Public Health Insurance

The ***Social Security Act Amendments (1965)*** created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

#### üç© Medicare Part D ‚ÄúDonut Hole‚Äù (Coverage Gap)

The ‚Äúdonut hole‚Äù is a temporary limit on what Medicare Part D will pay for prescription drugs.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Deductible Phase** | You pay 100% until your deductible is met (if plan has one).                                                                    |
| üí∏ **Initial Coverage** | You pay a **copay/coinsurance**; plan pays the rest. Ends when total drug costs (you + plan) hit a threshold (e.g., \~\$5,030). |
| üç© **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")** | You pay **25% of drug costs** (brand & generic). |
| üíØ **Catastrophic Coverage** | After your out-of-pocket costs hit the cap (\~\$8,000), you pay **nothing** or a small coinsurance per prescription. |

> üíä For techs: Patients in the donut hole may suddenly pay more‚Äîwatch for confusion or frustration and refer to the pharmacist.

#### üè• Medi-Cal (California Medicare Medicaid)

Medi-Cal is California‚Äôs combined Medicare Medicaid program, providing free or low-cost health coverage for:

- Low-income families and individuals
- Seniors (65+)
- People with disabilities
- Certain adults under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

It covers a wide range of services like doctor visits, hospital care, mental health, vision, dental, and prescriptions.

> üíä Pharmacy Tech Tip: Medi-Cal often uses a state drug formulary and may require Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) for some meds.

#### ü©∫ Medi-Medi (Dual Eligibility)

A ‚ÄúMedi-Medi‚Äù patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal.

Medicare is the primary payer; Medi-Cal acts as secondary, covering:

- Co-pays
- Deductibles
- Coinsurance
- These patients often qualify for extra help with Part D prescription drug costs.

> üß† Watch for ‚ÄúMedi-Medi‚Äù flags in patient profiles. These patients usually have no out-of-pocket cost for covered meds and medical care.

#### Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)

The **MMA** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Mangement (MTM)** Services.

## Formularies

**Formularies** (i.e. a list of drugs approved and made available for use) are often used to decide which medications to dispense to patients. In a hospital setting, it refers to drugs that are stocked by the pharmacy and approved for use in the facility. In retail, it refers to an approved drug list associated with a particular insurance benefit plan. In every case, every drug is identified by their 11-digit NDC.

### Generic Substitution

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.
