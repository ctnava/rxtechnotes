## 🧰 Key Concepts

Health insurance is a financial agreement where an individual or business pays a **monthly premium** to an insurance company, which in turn agrees to cover a portion of medical expenses incurred due to illness or injury. It acts as a safety net, protecting against the potentially high costs of medical care. Once **enrolled** in a **managed care program**, the patient must meet an **annual deductible** before coinsurance is applied. From there, the patient pays only a portion of the cost of service or medication (as **coinsurance or a copayment**) until they reach their **annual out-of-pocket maximum (OOP Max)**; after which covered services are paid 100% by the plan for the rest of the benefit year.

| Term | What It Means | Key Info |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 📅 **Enrollment** | The period when a patient can **sign up for or change** a plan. | Typically during **open enrollment** (fall) or due to a **qualifying life event** (e.g., marriage, birth, job change). |
| 💵 **Premium** | The **monthly payment** for health insurance, paid **regardless of use**. | Higher premium plans usually have lower deductibles or copays. |
| 💳 **Deductible** | The amount a patient pays **out of pocket** before coverage begins. | May be waived for preventive services or some generic drugs. |
| 🏥 **Managed Care Program**  | A structured healthcare plan that limits costs by controlling how patients receive care. | Includes HMOs, PPOs, POS, and EPOs. Emphasizes coordination and efficiency. |
| 📊 **Coinsurance** | A **percentage** of the cost paid by the patient after deductible is met (e.g., 20%). | Common for expensive procedures or specialty medications. |
| 💸 **Copayment (Copay)** | A **fixed amount** (e.g., \$10 or \$50) paid for a service or medication when received. | Typically varies by drug tier or service level. |
| ⛔ **Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOP Max)** | The **maximum total** a patient will pay in a year (including deductible, copays, coinsurance). | After this, insurance pays **100%** for covered services. |
| 💼 **Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)** | Third party administrator that manages the drug benefits for insurers, employers, Medicare Part D, etc. | A **distinct** entity. |
| 🛑 **Third Party Rejection (TPR)** | A **claim denial** from the insurance due to eligibility or processing errors. | May require corrections (e.g., wrong DOB, plan not active). |
| ⚠️ **Prior Authorization (PA)** | A **requirement for approval** before certain drugs or services are covered. | Often applies to expensive or non-preferred medications. |

> 💡 Pharmacy techs must often explain deductibles, PA delays, or TPRs to patients. Document carefully and involve the pharmacist when needed.

### 🏥 Managed Care Programs

Health insurers (both public & private) offer a variety of managed care programs with different fee structures. some managed care plans have single co-pays, dual co-pays, and three types of copays depending on the tier of service.

| Plan Type | Description | Referrals Needed? | Out-of-Network Coverage? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 🟦 **HMO** (Health Maintenance Organization) | Most restrictive. Requires you to choose a **Primary Care Provider (PCP)** who coordinates all care. | ✅ Yes, for specialists | ❌ No (emergencies only) |
| 🟧 **PPO** (Preferred Provider Organization) | Flexible. No need for referrals. Higher cost for out-of-network care. | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (higher cost) |
| 🟨 **POS** (Point of Service) | Hybrid of HMO & PPO. Requires PCP and referrals, but offers some out-of-network coverage. | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (with extra cost) |
| 🟪 **EPO** (Exclusive Provider Organization) | Like an HMO, but **no referrals required**. Still **no out-of-network** coverage (except emergencies). | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> 🧠 Pharmacy Tip: Always check insurance card or PBM portal for plan type and coverage rules. Most plans use **tiered copays** based on drug cost and type.

### 💊 Formularies

A **formulary** is an official list of prescription medications that are **approved for use** and covered by an institution or insurance plan. Formularies guide what medications can be **dispensed, substituted, or reimbursed**.

🏥 **In Hospital/Institutional Settings**:

- The formulary includes only the medications stocked and approved by the Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) Committee.
- Medications not on the formulary may require a non-formulary request or therapeutic substitution.
- Helps ensure cost-effective, evidence-based treatment for inpatients.

🛍️ **In Retail/Insurance Settings**:

- The formulary is the list of covered drugs under a patient’s insurance plan, usually managed by a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM).
- Medications are divided into tiers:
  - Tier 1: Preferred generics (lowest cost)
  - Tier 2: Preferred brand-name drugs
  - Tier 3: Non-preferred brands or specialty drugs
  - Tier 4+: High-cost or specialty medications (higher copay/coinsurance)

### 💼 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)

A PBM is a third-party company that manages the prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance plans, employers, Medicare Part D plans, and other payers. They act as a middleman between, pharmacies, health insurers/employers, & drug manufacturers.

| Role | PBM Responsibility |
|------|--------------------|
| 🛍️ **Claims Processing** | PBMs process prescription claims when a patient fills a medication at a pharmacy. |
| 💲 **Reimbursement Rates** | They determine how much pharmacies are paid and how much the patient pays (copay/coinsurance). |
| 📋 **Formulary Management** | PBMs design **formularies** (i.e. lists of covered drugs) and place them into **tiers** that affect pricing and access. |
| 🔐 **Prior Authorizations (PAs)** | PBMs require PAs for certain high-cost or high-risk drugs to control costs. |
| 🤝 **Manufacturer Rebates** | PBMs negotiate **rebates** and **discounts** from drug manufacturers in exchange for preferred placement on formularies. |
| 📦 **Mail-Order Pharmacy** | Many PBMs operate or partner with **mail-order pharmacies** for 90-day supplies or specialty meds. |

> 💡 **Common PBMs**: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, & OptumRx manage drug benefits for millions of patients nationwide.

### 📝 Prior Authorizations (PAs)

A **Prior Authorization (PA)** is a requirement by insurance companies (often managed by Pharmacy Benefit Managers or PBMs) that a healthcare provider must obtain approval by providing medical justification before a specific medication is covered by the patient's insurance. This process is used for **high-cost medications** (e.g., brand-name drugs without generic equivalents), **drugs with safety concerns** (e.g., opioid medications, certain antidepressants), **specialty drugs** (e.g., biologics, certain cancer treatments), **medications that require step therapy** (e.g., trying less expensive medications first), drugs not listed in the **formulary**, or drugs considered to have alternatives that are more cost-effective. When a drug isn’t covered or needs a PA, it’s usually the PBM’s rules, not the pharmacy’s.

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

> ⚠️ PAs are NOT required for emergency care.

The approval process typically involves submitting specific clinical information to the insurer, such as diagnosis codes, treatment history, or justification for why the prescribed drug is necessary over alternatives. From there insurers & PBMs review the request. If approved, the healthcare provider may proceed with service or the requested medication may be dispensed.

If a PA is needed, the technician typically works with the pharmacist to help gather necessary documentation, submit the PA request, and track the status of the request.

> ⚠️ **Medication Delays**: The process of obtaining a PA can delay medication dispensing. Technicians may need to inform patients about this delay and direct them to a pharmacist for further assistance. Processing can take **1–3 days**. Clear communication with patients about the PA process can help manage expectations. It’s essential for pharmacy technicians to explain why certain medications may require a PA and how long it might take to receive approval.

In outpatient care settings, PBMs influence what is covered, how much patients pay, and how pharmacies get reimbursed. Pharmacy technicians may encounter PAs in several scenarios, such as when a medication is not on the insurance company’s formulary, the prescribed medication requires additional review due to its cost or safety profile, or the insurance plan mandates a trial of a less expensive drug before approving the more expensive one. Pharmacy techs often use PBM portals to:

- Submit or check claims
- Review drug coverage
- Confirm copays and eligibility
- Assist with troubleshooting denials

> **Denial and Appeal**: If a PA is denied, technicians may help by ensuring the pharmacy has all required documentation or by assisting in the appeal process.

### 🔄 Coordination of Benefits (COB)

When patients have more than one plan, **COB** determines which is billed first and it:

- Prevents duplicate payments for the same service or prescription.
- Ensures the correct insurer is billed first to avoid claim denials or delays.
- Helps the pharmacy calculate the patient’s true out-of-pocket cost.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Primary Insurance** | Pays first up to its coverage limits. |
| **Secondary Insurance** | Pays some or all of what the primary didn’t cover. |
| **Tertiary Insurance**  | Rare third plan that covers remaining costs. |

**Pharmacy Technician Role**:

- Collect and enter all insurance cards.
- Enter insurance plans in correct order into the pharmacy system.
- Bill in correct order: primary → secondary → tertiary.
- Watch for Third Party Rejections like “other coverage primary.”
- Refer unclear COB issues to pharmacist or billing staff.

> 💡 **Tip**: If coverage isn’t set up correctly, the claim may reject or the patient may be charged the full price. Always verify COB status during intake for patients with multiple insurance plans.

## Public Health Insurance

The ***Social Security Act Amendments (1965)*** created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

| Part | Nickname | 📝 What It Covers | 💰 Costs | 💊 Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 🅰️   | Hospital Insurance | Inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing, hospice, home health | Usually "free" if worked 10+ years (payroll taxes) | Deductibles & coinsurance apply |
| 🅱️   | Medical Insurance  | Doctor visits, outpatient services, preventive care, DME | Monthly premium, deductible, 20% coinsurance | Optional; penalty if you delay enrollment |
| 🅲   | Medicare Advantage | Combines A & B (and usually D), run by private insurers | Varies by plan | May offer dental, vision, hearing, gym |
| 🅳   | Prescription Drug | Outpatient prescription drugs | Monthly premium, deductible, copays | Private plans available; penalty for late enrollment; Established by the MMA (2003) |

> **TRIVIA**: The ***Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010)*** was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

### 🍩 Medicare Part D “Donut Hole” (Coverage Gap)

The “donut hole” is a temporary limit on what Medicare Part D will pay for prescription drugs.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ **Deductible Phase** | You pay 100% until your deductible is met (if plan has one).                                                                    |
| 💸 **Initial Coverage** | You pay a **copay/coinsurance**; plan pays the rest. Ends when total drug costs (you + plan) hit a threshold (e.g., \~\$5,030). |
| 🍩 **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")** | You pay **25% of drug costs** (brand & generic). |
| 💯 **Catastrophic Coverage** | After your out-of-pocket costs hit the cap (\~\$8,000), you pay **nothing** or a small coinsurance per prescription. |

> 💊 For techs: Patients in the donut hole may suddenly pay more—watch for confusion or frustration and refer to the pharmacist.

### 🦾 Veterans Health Coverage: VA, TRICARE, & CHAMPVA

In addition to private and public insurance plans, some patients receive prescription drug coverage through programs specifically for military personnel, veterans, and their families. These programs include VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA. Each has unique eligibility rules, formularies, and pharmacy networks.

#### 🇺🇸 VA (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)

The VA provides healthcare (including prescriptions) to eligible veterans through VA medical facilities.

- Prescriptions are typically filled at **VA pharmacies** or via VA mail-order.
- The VA has its own **national formulary**, and medications must be prescribed by a **VA provider** to be covered.
- Outside pharmacies generally cannot bill the VA unless under special arrangements.
- Patients may have a small copayment, depending on their income and service-connected disability status.

> 💊 **Tech Tip**: If a patient brings a VA prescription to a retail pharmacy, it likely won’t be covered—refer them back to the VA system unless there’s a special authorization.

#### 🔺 TRICARE

TRICARE is the healthcare program for:

- Active-duty military members
- Retirees
- National Guard/Reserve members
- Their dependents

TRICARE is managed by the **Department of Defense (DoD)** and offers several plan types, including **TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life** (for Medicare-eligible retirees).

Pharmacy Benefits:

- Managed by Express Scripts.
- Covers prescriptions from:
  - Military treatment facility pharmacies (no copay)
  - TRICARE retail network pharmacies (small copay)
  - Mail-order pharmacy (cheapest option for long-term meds)
  - Formularies are tiered, and prior authorizations may be required for certain drugs.

> 📋 **Tech Tip**: Always check if the pharmacy is in-network for TRICARE. Verify eligibility using the patient’s military ID or DoD Benefits Number (DBN).

#### 🩺 CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs)

CHAMPVA provides coverage for spouses and dependent children of veterans who:

- Are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected condition, or
- Died as a result of a service-connected condition.

CHAMPVA is not the same as TRICARE, but similar in how it functions.

Key Points:

- CHAMPVA covers prescriptions filled at **retail pharmacies** or through Medicare **Part D plans** (if eligible).
- Claims may need to be **submitted manually** if the pharmacy isn’t set up for electronic CHAMPVA billing.
- CHAMPVA may act as **secondary insurance** if the patient has another plan.

> 🧠 **Tech Tip**: CHAMPVA patients may carry a special ID card. Verify the plan and check reimbursement procedures. CHAMPVA doesn’t always process like standard insurance.

| Program | Who It Covers | Where Prescriptions Are Filled | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **VA** | Veterans enrolled in VA health care | VA pharmacies or VA mail-order | Must be prescribed by a VA provider |
| **TRICARE** | Active-duty, retired military, and families | Military pharmacies, TRICARE retail network, mail-order | Managed by Express Scripts |
| **CHAMPVA** | Dependents of disabled/deceased veterans | Retail pharmacies, sometimes Medicare Part D | May require manual claim submission |

> ⚠️ Always verify insurance details for military and veteran patients—coverage rules and pharmacy networks vary significantly between VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA.

### 🏥 Medi-Cal (California Medicaid)

Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program, providing free or low-cost health coverage for:

- Low-income families and individuals
- Seniors (65+)
- People with disabilities
- Certain adults under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

It covers a wide range of services like doctor visits, hospital care, mental health, vision, dental, and prescriptions.

> 💊 Pharmacy Tech Tip: Medi-Cal often uses a state drug formulary and may require Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) for some meds.

### 🩺 Medi-Medi (Dual Eligibility)

A “Medi-Medi” patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal.

Medicare is the primary payer; Medi-Cal acts as secondary, covering:

- Co-pays
- Deductibles
- Coinsurance
- These patients often qualify for extra help with Part D prescription drug costs.

> 🧠 Watch for “Medi-Medi” flags in patient profiles. These patients usually have no out-of-pocket cost for covered meds and medical care.

## Social Health Insurance & Public Assistance

### 🛠️ Workers’ Compensation (Workers’ Comp)

Workers’ compensation is a type of insurance that provides medical and wage benefits to employees who are injured or become ill due to their job.

How It Affects the Pharmacy:

- Covers medications directly related to the work injury.
- Prescriptions must be approved and billed through the employer’s workers’ comp insurance (not the patient’s regular insurance).
- The claim is processed through a special claims processor or pharmacy network, not a PBM.
- Patients usually pay $0 out of pocket, but only for approved medications.

Pharmacy Technician Role:

- **Verify claim details**: name of employer, date of injury, claim number, and insurance carrier.
- Check for **third-party billing instructions** often sent through a workers’ comp pharmacy network (e.g., Coventry, One Call).
- If a medication is **not covered**, refer to the pharmacist or contact the claims adjuster for clarification.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Workers’ comp claims are not processed through the patient’s regular insurance card. Do not collect copays unless instructed by the plan.

### 🤝 Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs)

Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) are sponsored by drug manufacturers, non-profits, or foundations to help patients access expensive or essential medications often for free or at a reduced cost.

Who Qualifies:

- Uninsured or underinsured patients
- Patients who cannot afford their copay or coinsurance
- Must meet income eligibility criteria, which vary by program

Types of Assistance:

- Free medication directly from the manufacturer (often mailed to patient or provider)
- Copay assistance that lowers the patient’s out-of-pocket cost
- Foundation grants for chronic or high-cost conditions (e.g., cancer, HIV, MS)

How Pharmacy Staff Can Help:

- Inform patients about PAPs when they can’t afford meds
- Help gather documentation (insurance info, income proof, prescription)
- Some pharmacy systems or hospital case managers may handle applications

> 💡 **Tech Tip**: PAPs are not billed through insurance. If approved, drugs may be shipped to the pharmacy or to the patient’s home. Always verify handling instructions.

| Program Type | Who It's For | How It's Billed | Key Role of Tech |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Workers’ Comp** | Patients injured at work | Through employer’s WC insurer | Verify claim info, process with WC billing, no copay |
| **PAP** | Uninsured or low-income patients | Not billed—meds sent free or discounted | Help with enrollment, documentation, or referrals |

> 🧠 When patients can't afford their medication, explore both workers’ comp eligibility (if job-related) and assistance programs and always consult the pharmacist for next steps.
