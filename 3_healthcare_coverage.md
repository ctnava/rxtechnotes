# Chapter 3: Healthcare Coverage

This chapter introduces key aspects of health insurance and how they impact pharmacy operations.

---

## 🧰 Key Concepts

Health insurance is a financial agreement where an individual or business pays a **monthly premium** to an insurance company, which in turn agrees to cover a portion of medical expenses incurred due to illness or injury. It acts as a safety net, protecting against the potentially high costs of medical care. Once **enrolled** in a **managed care program**, the patient must meet an **annual deductible** before coinsurance is applied. From there, the patient pays only a portion of the cost of service or medication (as **coinsurance or a copayment**) until they reach their **annual out-of-pocket maximum (OOP Max)**; after which covered services are paid 100% by the plan for the rest of the benefit year.

| Term | What It Means | Key Info |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 📅 **Enrollment** | The period when a patient can **sign up for or change** a plan. | Typically during **open enrollment** (fall) or due to a **qualifying life event** (e.g., marriage, birth, job change). |
| 💵 **Premium** | The **monthly payment** for health insurance, paid **regardless of use**. | Higher premium plans usually have lower deductibles or copays. |
| 💳 **Deductible** | The amount a patient pays **out of pocket** before coverage begins. | May be waived for preventive services or some generic drugs. |
| 🏥 **Managed Care Program**  | A structured healthcare plan that limits costs by controlling how patients receive care. | Includes HMOs, PPOs, POS, and EPOs. Emphasizes coordination and efficiency. |
| 📊 **Coinsurance** | A **percentage** of the cost paid by the patient after deductible is met (e.g., 20%). | Common for expensive procedures or specialty medications. |
| 💸 **Copayment (Copay)** | A **fixed amount** (e.g., \$10 or \$50) paid for a service or medication when received. | Typically varies by drug tier or service level. |
| ⛔ **Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOP Max)** | The **maximum total** a patient will pay in a year (including deductible, copays, coinsurance). | After this, insurance pays **100%** for covered services. |
| 💼 **Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)** | Third party administrator that manages the drug benefits for insurers, employers, Medicare Part D, etc. | A **distinct** entity. |
| ⚙️ **Adjudication** | The real-time process where insurance (via the PBM) evaluates a prescription claim. | Determines coverage, patient cost, and whether the prescription is accepted or rejected. |
| 🛑 **Third Party Rejection (TPR)** | A **claim denial** from the insurance due to eligibility or processing errors. | May require corrections (e.g., wrong DOB, plan not active). |
| ⚠️ **Prior Authorization (PA)** | A **requirement for approval** before certain drugs or services are covered. | Often applies to expensive or non-preferred medications. |

> 💡 **Tech Tip**: Document all patient interactions about PAs, rejections, and delays. Escalate to pharmacist when necessary.

### 🏥 Managed Care Programs

Managed care plans are offered by insurers (public and private); structured to control healthcare costs and improve care coordination.

| Plan Type | Description | Referrals Needed? | Out-of-Network Coverage? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 🟦 **HMO** (Health Maintenance Organization) | Most restrictive. Requires you to choose a **Primary Care Provider (PCP)** who coordinates all care. | ✅ Yes, for specialists | ❌ No (emergencies only) |
| 🟧 **PPO** (Preferred Provider Organization) | Flexible. No need for referrals. Higher cost for out-of-network care. | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (higher cost) |
| 🟨 **POS** (Point of Service) | Hybrid of HMO & PPO. Requires PCP and referrals, but offers some out-of-network coverage. | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (with extra cost) |
| 🟪 **EPO** (Exclusive Provider Organization) | Like an HMO, but **no referrals required**, still **no out-of-network coverage** (except emergencies). | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> 🔍 Check insurance cards or PBM portals for plan types. Copays are often tiered based on drug cost.

### 💊 Formularies

A **formulary** is a list of medications approved and covered by an insurer or institution. Formularies guide what medications can be **dispensed, substituted, or reimbursed**.

🏥 **Institutional Formularies**:

- Controlled by the **Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) Committee**.
- Only stocked medications are dispensed.
- Non-formulary requests or therapeutic substitutions may be required.

🛍️ **In Retail/Insurance Settings**:

- Managed by PBMs (in retail/insurance settings).
- Drugs are divided into **tiers** that affect patient cost:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | Preferred generics (lowest cost) |
| Tier 2 | Preferred brand-name drugs |
| Tier 3 | Non-preferred brands |
| Tier 4+ | High-cost or specialty medications |

### 💼 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)

PBMs are third-party companies that manage drug benefits on behalf of payers (insurers, employers, Medicare).

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🛍️ **Claims Processing** | Handle real-time claim adjudication. |
| 💲 **Reimbursement Rates** | Set copays and pharmacy payouts. |
| 📋 **Formulary Management** | Create and manage drug tiers. |
| 🔐 **Prior Authorizations** | Require clinical justification for certain drugs. |
| 🤝 **Manufacturer Rebates** | Negotiate discounts for formulary placement. |
| 📦 **Mail-Order Pharmacy** | Operate/contract mail pharmacies for long-term meds. |

> 💡 **Common PBMs**: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, & OptumRx manage drug benefits for millions of patients nationwide.

### 📝 Prior Authorizations (PAs)

A **Prior Authorization (PA)** is a requirement by insurance companies (often managed by Pharmacy Benefit Managers or PBMs) that a healthcare provider must obtain approval by providing medical justification before a specific medication is covered by the patient's insurance. This process is used for **high-cost medications** (e.g., brand-name drugs without generic equivalents), **drugs with safety concerns** (e.g., opioid medications, certain antidepressants), **specialty drugs** (e.g., biologics, certain cancer treatments), **medications that require step therapy** (e.g., trying less expensive medications first), drugs not listed in the **formulary**, or drugs considered to have alternatives that are more cost-effective. When a drug isn’t covered or needs a PA, it’s usually the PBM’s rules, not the pharmacy’s.

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or PA, the patient usually may have to pay full price without insurance coverage.

> ⚠️ PAs are NOT required for emergency care.

The approval process typically involves submitting specific clinical information to the insurer, such as diagnosis codes, treatment history, or justification for why the prescribed drug is necessary over alternatives. From there, insurers & PBMs review the request. If approved, the healthcare provider may proceed with service or the requested medication may be dispensed.

If a PA is needed, the technician typically works with the pharmacist to help gather necessary documentation, submit the PA request, and track the status of the request.

> ⚠️ **Medication Delays**: The process of obtaining a PA can delay medication dispensing. Technicians may need to inform patients about this delay and direct them to a pharmacist for further assistance. Processing can take **1–3 days**. Clear communication with patients about the PA process can help manage expectations. It’s essential for pharmacy technicians to explain why certain medications may require a PA and how long it might take to receive approval.

In outpatient care settings, PBMs influence what is covered, how much patients pay, and how pharmacies get reimbursed. Pharmacy technicians may encounter PAs in several scenarios, such as when a medication is not on the insurance company’s formulary, the prescribed medication requires additional review due to its cost or safety profile, or the insurance plan mandates a trial of a less expensive drug before approving the more expensive one. Pharmacy techs often use PBM portals to:

- Submit or check claims
- Review drug coverage
- Confirm copays and eligibility
- Assist with troubleshooting denials

> **Denial and Appeal**: If a PA is denied, technicians may help by ensuring the pharmacy has all required documentation or by assisting in the appeal process.

### 👤 Patient Intake & Profile Creation

Before a prescription can be processed or billed, a patient profile must be created in the pharmacy management system. This includes entering key information that ensures accuracy during claim adjudication and compliance with regulations.

**Required Fields**:

- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Address and contact information
- Gender
- Allergies (use "NKA" if there are no known allergies)
- Health conditions
- Current medications (prescriptions, supplements, & OTC)
- Insurance Information

Technicians must:

- Verify information directly from the patient and their insurance card.
- Ensure accuracy (especially date of birth, spelling, and ID numbers) to avoid claim rejections.
- Update records annually or when patient details change.

**Insurance Card Details**:

In addition to the basic Patient Identifierrmation, the following details must be collected from the insurance card:

| Information | Category | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Card Issuer Name/Logo** | Insurer Identifier | Name or logo of the insurance company issuing the card. |
| **Card Issuer ID** | Insurer Identifier | Unique ID for the insurance company that issued the card. |
| **Member Name** | Patient Identifier | Full name of the patient as listed on the insurance card. |
| **Member ID** | Patient Identifier | Unique identification number for the patient under the plan. |
| **Person Codes** | Patient Identifier | Identifiers for specific individuals covered (e.g., primary member, spouse). |
| **Group Number** | Patient Identifier | Identifies the patient's insurance plan. |
| **Gender** | Patient Identifier | Gender of the patient. |
| **Date of Birth** | Patient Identifier | The patient's date of birth, critical for claim accuracy. |
| **Card Issue/Effective Date** | Billing & Claims | Date when the insurance coverage began or card was issued. |
| **Co-pays** | Billing & Claims | Patient’s co-payment amounts for different services (e.g., medications). |
| **RXBIN** | Billing & Claims | Bank Identification Number for pharmacy claims processing. |
| **RXPCN** | Billing & Claims | Processor Control Number used for managing prescription claims. |
| **Name and Address of Benefit Administrator** | Billing & Claims | Company or agency responsible for managing benefits. |
| **Pharmacy Help Desk Number** | Billing & Claims  | Contact number for pharmacies to resolve claim issues. |
| **Phone Number for Member Help Desk** | Patient Use Only | Customer service phone number for patient inquiries. |

> ⚠️ **Tech Tip**: Always confirm insurance data from the most recent insurance card to avoid billing errors and Third Party Rejections.

### 🔁 Billing & Adjudication

Prescription billing is the process of submitting a claim to a patient’s insurance via a real-time adjudication system, typically operated by the PBM. This process confirms whether a medication is covered, calculates the patient’s share, and notifies the pharmacy of any issues.

1. ***Patient profile setup***: Insurance information is collected and entered into the pharmacy system.
2. ***Prescription claim submission***: The pharmacy system transmits patient/dose/drug info to the PBM.
3. ***Real-time response***: The PBM evaluates coverage, applies plan rules (like copays, deductibles, prior authorization), and returns an approval or rejection.
4. ***Point-of-sale***: Patient is charged based on insurer response. The pharmacy is reimbursed according to its contract with the PBM.

| Step | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| Enter insurance BIN/PCN/ID | Identifies the PBM and patient |
| Transmit prescription details | Drug, days’ supply, NDC, prescriber info |
| Adjudication | PBM checks eligibility, coverage, cost-sharing |
| Response | Approved (with copay) or Rejected (with reason code) |

#### Online Claim Information

This table should help clarify the essential details when processing prescription claims for adjudication.

| Information | Category | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Cardholder/Member ID Number** | Patient Identifier | Unique ID number for the patient’s insurance cardholder/member. |
| **Group Number** | Patient Identifier | The group number associated with the patient's insurance plan. |
| **Name of Patient** | Patient Identifier | Full name of the patient as listed on the insurance card. |
| **Birth Date** | Patient Identifier | Patient's date of birth for eligibility verification. |
| **Sex** | Patient Identifier | Gender of the patient as listed on the insurance card. |
| **Relationship to Cardholder** | Patient Identifier | The patient’s relationship to the cardholder (e.g., C=cardholder, S=spouse, D=dependent, O=other). |
| **Date Rx Written** | Prescription Details | The date when the prescription was originally written by the prescriber. |
| **Date Rx Dispensed** | Prescription Details | The date when the prescription was dispensed to the patient. |
| **New Prescription or Refill** | Prescription Details | Indicates if the prescription is new or a refill. |
| **NDC** | Prescription Details | National Drug Code identifying the medication dispensed. |
| **DAW Code** | Prescription Details | Dispense As Written code indicating product selection rules. |
| **Amount or Quantity Dispensed** | Prescription Details | The amount or quantity of the medication dispensed to the patient. |
| **Days Supply** | Prescription Details | The number of days the medication is expected to last based on the dosage. |
| **Prescribing Physician's ID Number** | Prescriber Identifier | Unique ID number for the physician who prescribed the medication. |
| **Pharmacy ID/NPI** | Pharmacy Identifier | Unique pharmacy identifier or National Provider Identifier (NPI) for the dispensing pharmacy. |
| **Ingredient Cost** | Pricing Information | The cost of the medication’s active ingredients. |
| **Dispensing Fee** | Pricing Information | The fee charged by the pharmacy for dispensing the medication. |
| **Total Price** | Pricing Information | Total amount charged for the prescription (ingredient cost + dispensing fee). |
| **Deductible or Copay Amount** | Pricing Information | The portion of the cost the patient is responsible for, based on their plan. |
| **Balance Due** | Pricing Information | The remaining balance due after insurance payment and copay/deductible. |

#### 🛑 Third-Party Rejections & Resolutions

A Third-Party Rejection (TPR) occurs when a prescription claim is denied by the PBM or insurance. These denials are flagged with a reject code and message explaining the issue.

| Rejection | Reason | Resolution |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Patient not Covered | Coverage terminated | Update insurance info |
| Invalid Birth Date | Mismatch with insurance card | Verify DOB with patient |
| Invalid Person Code | Incorrect ID or gender | Verify with patient |
| Refill Too Soon | Prescription too early for refill | Inform patient of date limitation |
| NDC not Covered | Drug not covered by plan | Contact prescriber for alternative |
| Prior Authorization Required | Drug needs PA | Submit PA request |

> 📍 **Tech Tip**: Always confirm the BIN/PCN/ID from the most recent insurance card. These fields determine where the claim is sent.

#### 💲 Reimbursement, Pricing, & Billing Models

Understanding how prescriptions are priced and reimbursed is essential for pharmacy technicians, especially when dealing with insurance billing, patient copays, or third-party rejections.

##### 🧮 Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC)

MAC is a cost-containment strategy used by PBMs to set the maximum amount they will reimburse a pharmacy for a generic drug or group of equivalent drugs. If a pharmacy’s acquisition cost exceeds the MAC, it may lose money on the transaction unless it charges the patient the difference.

- MAC applies only to multi-source (generic) drugs.
- Set by PBMs or insurers, not manufacturers or pharmacies.
- May vary between PBMs for the same drug.

> ⚠️ If the pharmacy’s purchase price is higher than the MAC reimbursement, the claim may result in a financial loss unless the pharmacy adjusts the price charged to the patient.

##### 💵 Usual and Customary (U&C / UCR) Price

The Usual & Customary or UCR price is the amount a pharmacy would charge a cash-paying customer for a given prescription. Insurers compare this price to their negotiated rates. Sometimes called the "cash price" or "retail price".

The insurer will pay the lowest of:

- The U&C price
- The PBM's allowed cost
- The MAC
- The contracted reimbursement formula

> 💡 The U&C price must be accurate and current in the pharmacy system. If it's incorrectly low, the PBM may reimburse at that amount (even if it’s below cost).

##### 📄 Universal Claim Form (UCF)

The Universal Claim Form (UCF) is a standardized paper form used to submit prescription claims to insurance providers when electronic billing is unavailable or rejected.

- Created by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP).
- Used in long-term care, retroactive billing, or when online adjudication fails.
- Includes all critical data: patient info, drug details, NDC, prescriber ID, pharmacy ID, cost info, etc.

> 📄 UCFs must be completed accurately and legibly. Errors lead to claim rejections or delays.

##### 🏢 In-House Billing

In-house billing is when a pharmacy submits claims directly to insurers (usually medical, not pharmacy insurance) without using a PBM. This occurs in specialized settings like:

- Compounding pharmacies
- Specialty clinics
- Hospitals dispensing outpatient medications

In-house billing uses CMS-1500 or UB-04 medical billing forms instead of the UCF or NCPDP format. Claims are submitted to medical insurance (e.g., Medicare Part B) for injectables, DME, or physician-administered drugs. Requires knowledge of CPT/HCPCS codes and diagnosis codes (ICD-10).

> ⚠️ Medical insurance adjudication is slower and more documentation-heavy than pharmacy claims.

### 🔄 Coordination of Benefits (COB)

When patients have more than one plan, **COB** determines which is billed first and it:

- Prevents duplicate payments for the same service or prescription.
- Ensures the correct insurer is billed first to avoid claim denials or delays.
- Helps the pharmacy calculate the patient’s true out-of-pocket cost.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Primary Insurance** | Pays first up to its coverage limits. |
| **Secondary Insurance** | Pays some or all of what the primary didn’t cover. |
| **Tertiary Insurance**  | Rare third plan that covers remaining costs. |

**Pharmacy Technician Role**:

- Collect and enter all insurance cards.
- Enter insurance plans in correct order into the pharmacy system.
- Bill in correct order: primary → secondary → tertiary.
- Watch for Third Party Rejections like “other coverage primary.”
- Refer unclear COB issues to pharmacist or billing staff.

> 💡 Incorrect COB setup leads to claim denials or full patient cost. Verify COB at patient intake.

### Social Health Insurance & Public Assistance

#### 🛠️ Workers’ Compensation (Workers’ Comp)

Workers’ compensation is a type of insurance that provides medical and wage benefits to employees who are injured or become ill due to their job.

How It Affects the Pharmacy:

- Covers medications directly related to the work injury.
- Prescriptions must be approved and billed through the employer’s workers’ comp insurance (not the patient’s regular insurance).
- The claim is processed through a special claims processor or pharmacy network, not a PBM.
- Patients usually pay $0 out of pocket, but only for approved medications.

Pharmacy Technician Role:

- **Verify claim details**: name of employer, date of injury, claim number, and insurance carrier.
- Check for **third-party billing instructions** often sent through a workers’ comp pharmacy network (e.g., Coventry, One Call).
- If a medication is **not covered**, refer to the pharmacist or contact the claims adjuster for clarification.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Workers’ comp claims are not processed through the patient’s regular insurance card. Do not collect copays unless instructed by the plan.

#### 🤝 Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs)

Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) are sponsored by drug manufacturers, non-profits, or foundations to help patients access expensive or essential medications often for free or at a reduced cost.

Who Qualifies:

- Uninsured or underinsured patients
- Patients who cannot afford their copay or coinsurance
- Must meet income eligibility criteria, which vary by program

Types of Assistance:

- Free medication directly from the manufacturer (often mailed to patient or provider)
- Copay assistance that lowers the patient’s out-of-pocket cost
- Foundation grants for chronic or high-cost conditions (e.g., cancer, HIV, MS)

How Pharmacy Staff Can Help:

- Inform patients about PAPs when they can’t afford meds
- Help gather documentation (insurance info, income proof, prescription)
- Some pharmacy systems or hospital case managers may handle applications

> 💡 **Tech Tip**: PAPs are not billed through insurance. If approved, drugs may be shipped to the pharmacy or to the patient’s home. Always verify handling instructions.

| Program Type | Who It's For | How It's Billed | Key Role of Tech |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Workers’ Comp** | Patients injured at work | Through employer’s WC insurer | Verify claim info, process with WC billing, no copay |
| **PAP** | Uninsured or low-income patients | Not billed—meds sent free or discounted | Help with enrollment, documentation, or referrals |

> 🧠 When patients can't afford their medication, explore both workers’ comp eligibility (if job-related) and assistance programs and always consult the pharmacist for next steps.

## Public Health Insurance

The ***Social Security Act Amendments (1965)*** created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

| Part | Nickname | 📝 What It Covers | 💰 Costs | 💊 Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 🅰️   | Hospital Insurance | Inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing, hospice, home health | Usually "free" if worked 10+ years (payroll taxes) | Deductibles & coinsurance apply |
| 🅱️   | Medical Insurance  | Doctor visits, outpatient services, preventive care, DME | Monthly premium, deductible, 20% coinsurance | Optional; penalty if you delay enrollment |
| 🅲   | Medicare Advantage | Combines A & B (and usually D), run by private insurers | Varies by plan | May offer dental, vision, hearing, gym |
| 🅳   | Prescription Drug | Outpatient prescription drugs | Monthly premium, deductible, copays | Private plans available; penalty for late enrollment; Established by the MMA (2003) |

> **TRIVIA**: The ***Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010)*** was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

### 🍩 Medicare Part D “Donut Hole” (Coverage Gap)

The “donut hole” is a temporary limit on what Medicare Part D will pay for prescription drugs.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ **Deductible Phase** | You pay 100% until your deductible is met (if plan has one).                                                                    |
| 💸 **Initial Coverage** | You pay a **copay/coinsurance**; plan pays the rest. Ends when total drug costs (you + plan) hit a threshold (e.g., \~\$5,030). |
| 🍩 **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")** | You pay **25% of drug costs** (brand & generic). |
| 💯 **Catastrophic Coverage** | After your out-of-pocket costs hit the cap (\~\$8,000), you pay **nothing** or a small coinsurance per prescription. |

> 💊 For techs: Patients in the donut hole may suddenly pay more—watch for confusion or frustration and refer to the pharmacist.

### 🦾 Veterans Health Coverage: VA, TRICARE, & CHAMPVA

In addition to private and public insurance plans, some patients receive prescription drug coverage through programs specifically for military personnel, veterans, and their families. These programs include VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA. Each has unique eligibility rules, formularies, and pharmacy networks.

#### 🇺🇸 VA (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)

The VA provides healthcare (including prescriptions) to eligible veterans through VA medical facilities.

- Prescriptions are typically filled at **VA pharmacies** or via VA mail-order.
- The VA has its own **national formulary**, and medications must be prescribed by a **VA provider** to be covered.
- Outside pharmacies generally cannot bill the VA unless under special arrangements.
- Patients may have a small copayment, depending on their income and service-connected disability status.

> 💊 **Tech Tip**: If a patient brings a VA prescription to a retail pharmacy, it likely won’t be covered—refer them back to the VA system unless there’s a special authorization.

#### 🔺 TRICARE

TRICARE is the healthcare program for:

- Active-duty military members
- Retirees
- National Guard/Reserve members
- Their dependents

TRICARE is managed by the **Department of Defense (DoD)** and offers several plan types, including **TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life** (for Medicare-eligible retirees).

Pharmacy Benefits:

- Managed by Express Scripts.
- Covers prescriptions from:
  - Military treatment facility pharmacies (no copay)
  - TRICARE retail network pharmacies (small copay)
  - Mail-order pharmacy (cheapest option for long-term meds)
  - Formularies are tiered, and prior authorizations may be required for certain drugs.

> 📋 **Tech Tip**: Always check if the pharmacy is in-network for TRICARE. Verify eligibility using the patient’s military ID or DoD Benefits Number (DBN).

#### 🩺 CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs)

CHAMPVA provides coverage for spouses and dependent children of veterans who:

- Are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected condition, or
- Died as a result of a service-connected condition.

CHAMPVA is not the same as TRICARE, but similar in how it functions.

Key Points:

- CHAMPVA covers prescriptions filled at **retail pharmacies** or through Medicare **Part D plans** (if eligible).
- Claims may need to be **submitted manually** if the pharmacy isn’t set up for electronic CHAMPVA billing.
- CHAMPVA may act as **secondary insurance** if the patient has another plan.

> 🧠 **Tech Tip**: CHAMPVA patients may carry a special ID card. Verify the plan and check reimbursement procedures. CHAMPVA doesn’t always process like standard insurance.

| Program | Who It Covers | Where Prescriptions Are Filled | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **VA** | Veterans enrolled in VA health care | VA pharmacies or VA mail-order | Must be prescribed by a VA provider |
| **TRICARE** | Active-duty, retired military, and families | Military pharmacies, TRICARE retail network, mail-order | Managed by Express Scripts |
| **CHAMPVA** | Dependents of disabled/deceased veterans | Retail pharmacies, sometimes Medicare Part D | May require manual claim submission |

> ⚠️ Always verify insurance details for military and veteran patients—coverage rules and pharmacy networks vary significantly between VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA.

### 🏥 Medi-Cal (California Medicaid)

Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program, providing free or low-cost health coverage for:

- Low-income families and individuals
- Seniors (65+)
- People with disabilities
- Certain adults under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

It covers a wide range of services like doctor visits, hospital care, mental health, vision, dental, and prescriptions.

> 💊 Pharmacy Tech Tip: Medi-Cal often uses a state drug formulary and may require Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) for some meds.

### 🩺 Medi-Medi (Dual Eligibility)

A “Medi-Medi” patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal.

Medicare is the primary payer; Medi-Cal acts as secondary, covering:

- Co-pays
- Deductibles
- Coinsurance
- These patients often qualify for extra help with Part D prescription drug costs.

> 🧠 Watch for “Medi-Medi” flags in patient profiles. These patients usually have no out-of-pocket cost for covered meds and medical care.
