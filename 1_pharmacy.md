# Chapter 1: Pharmacies - Duties, Services, Law, & Ethics

## Ethics

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that helps decide what should be done in a principled sense besides what must be done to comply with laws. In the medical industry, universities, colleges, hospitals, and other organizations form Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) (or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)) to provide ethical guidance and ensure legal & ethical standards are followed. ERBs in hospitals can provide consultation for difficult ethical cases when they arise. Corporate compliance officers are responsible to investigate legal or ethical concerns identified in a business.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provide the following guidelines for compliance with federal and state law:

- the maintenance of written policies and procedures
- designation of a compliance officer and committee
- conducting effective training and education
- developing effective lines of communication
- auditing and monitoring
- enforcement through publicized disciplinary guidelines and policies dealing with ineligible persons
- responding to detected offenses, developing corrective action initiatives, and reporting to government authorities

Some basic values in ethical considerations include:

- **Autonomy** of the patient to choose their treatment
  - ⚠️ *Federal law protects the patient's right to refuse treatment*
- **Beneficence** when treating patients
- **Dignification** of the patient
- **Non-Maleficence** when providing care
- **Justice** in healthcare
- **Honesty** in patient communication

## Pharmacy Personnel

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the pharmacist's skill or expertise.

### Pharmacy Clerk/ Assistant

Pharmacy clerks (also called assistants) are **unlicensed personnel** who support front-end operations and customer service. They typically need only a high school diploma and on-the-job training. Their duties include:

- **Customer Service**: Greeting customers, answering phones, accepting prescriptions
- **Data Entry**: Inputting patient and insurance information into the pharmacy system
- **Inventory Tasks**: Stocking shelves, checking stock levels, receiving shipments
- **Payment Processing**: Handling customer payments and receipts
- **Clerical Work**: Filing records, organizing paperwork

> 🛑 **Note**: In some states, clerks may not be permitted to enter or access prescription data.

### Pharmacy Technicians (PhT)

Pharmacy technicians are **healthcare professionals** who assist pharmacists with technical tasks. In some states, techs are only registered, not licensed. At minimum states require that technicians are **registered (and usually licensed)**, while some employers may also require **national certification**. Their scope of practice typically includes:

- **Prescription Processing**: Receiving and processing medication orders, measuring and preparing dosages
- **Labeling**: Packaging and labeling medications with usage instructions
- **Insurance Processing**: Assisting with insurance claims and patient billing
- **Compounding**: Preparing sterile and non-sterile medications under pharmacist supervision
- **Patient Records**: Collecting and entering patient data into pharmacy systems
- **Inventory Management**: Monitoring stock and notifying pharmacists of shortages

### Pharmacist Interns

Interns are pharmacy students enrolled in a PharmD program and working under a **pharmacist’s supervision**. They typically hold an **intern license**. Responsibilities include:

- **Patient Interaction**: Taking medication histories and verifying prescriptions
- **Medication Prep**: Counting, packaging, and labeling prescriptions
- **Administrative Support**: Entering data, monitoring inventory, and maintaining records

### Pharmacist

Pharmacists are healthcare professionals licensed to **dispense medications**, **counsel patients**, and **oversee pharmacy operations**. They must hold a **Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)** degree and pass the **NAPLEX and MPJE** for licensure. Their duties include:

- **Prescription Review**: Ensuring accuracy, safety, and clarity in filled prescriptions
- **Patient Education**: Explaining medication use, side effects, and safety
- **Drug Interaction Checks**: Monitoring for potential medication conflicts
- **Administering Vaccines**: Providing immunizations (as allowed by state law)
- **Health Screenings**: Conducting blood pressure checks and other basic screenings

## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- If laws conflict, the **stricter law must be followed**.

> ⚠️ Federal law protects the patient's right to file complaints.

### Regulatory Bodies

#### Federal Agencies

- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: Established by the *Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)*. Oversees safety and regulation of drugs, devices, cosmetics, supplements, and radiation-emitting products.
- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: Enforces the *Controlled Substances Act (1970)* and regulates controlled substances.
- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**: The primary federal agency responsible for protecting the health of all Americans. Oversees public health programs and agencies including the CDC, FDA, CMS, and NIH. During public health emergencies, HHS can expand access to care through guidance and waivers (e.g., authorizing technicians to administer vaccines).

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

- **License Portability**: California has **no reciprocity**; technicians moving to other states must reapply there. Returning to CA may require full reapplication if the license was canceled

### ⚖️ Court of Law

Judicial law has two main divisions:

- **Criminal Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to society
- **Civil Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to an individual

In civil law, there are two major subdivisions:

- **Contracts**: legal agreements that have duties associated with them
- **Torts**: civil wrongs that have duties associated with them, created by law

Torts are a branch of civil law in which the courts determine remedies for alleged harm suffered by people who have no formal relationship with the offender and the majority of court cases involving pharmacists are torts. These are typically **negligence lawsuits**, where a person or legal party who failed to use reasonable caution when providing care or services which resulted in damages to the victim. **Malpractice** is a type of negligence lawsuit brough against a person with a professional license.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.

#### 💊 Medication Safety Practices & Errors

**Medication safety** is crucial to reducing errors and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. Pharmacy technicians play a key role in maintaining safety by ✅*adhering to proper procedures*, ⚠️*identifying potential risks*, and 👩‍⚕️*collaborating with pharmacists*.

**Medication errors** can occur at any stage of the medication-use process. Patient safety depends on accurate prescription processing and dispensing, for which the FDA, ISMP, and USP provide safety guidelines. Common medication errors include:

- ❌ **Prescribing Errors**: incorrect drug selection, dose, or instructions
- ✍️ **Transcription Errors**: data entry mistakes leading to incorrect labels
- 💊 **Dispensing Errors**: wrong medication, strength, or dosage form
- ⛔ **Administration Errors**: Incorrect patient instructions
- 👀 **Monitoring Errors**: Failure to detect interactions or reactions

##### 🔐 Error Prevention Strategies

- 🔄 Double-check all prescriptions before dispensing
- 🏷️ Use barcodes to verify medication
- 🗣️ Maintain clear communication with pharmacists and prescribers
- 📝 Report and document errors for quality improvement
- ✅ Follow the Five Rights when dispensing:
  - ✔️ Right Patient
  - ✔️ Right Drug
  - ✔️ Right Dose
  - ✔️ Right Route
  - ✔️ Right Timing

##### 🛡️ Best Practices for Safe Handling

- 🏠 Store medications properly to maintain potency and prevent contamination
- 🏷️ Label medications clearly and include expiration dates
- 📚 Educate patients on proper medication use and side effects
- 📂 Keep accurate records and update patient profiles
- 🎓 Engage in continuous training on safety procedures

### Important Legislation

Below are vital pieces of legislation to know as a pharmacy technician.

#### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

Ensures workplace safety. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

> ⚠️ Chemotherapy agents and other hazardous drugs must have Safety Data Sheets!

#### The Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) - 1996

HIPAA protects patient privacy by regulating how **Covered Entities** handle **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. It is a large statute that primarily concerns the continuation of health insurance coverage for workers who leave their jobs. UAll personnel that have access to PHI must be formally trained periodically on HIPAA regulations to stay up to date and there must be a designated privacy officer appointed on duty.

- **Covered Entities**: Individuals or organizations that are subject to HIPAA regulations because they handle protected health information (PHI) in connection with standard electronic transactions. Covered entities include:
  - **Health Plans**: Insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid
  - **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, and other licensed providers who transmit health data electronically
  - **Healthcare Clearinghouses**: Entities that process or facilitate the processing of nonstandard health information into a standard format

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information (oral, written, or electronic) that can be used to identify a patient and that relates to the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare. PHI is protected under HIPAA and must be kept confidential by all Covered Entities and Business Associates. Under HIPAA, this information must be safeguarded through administrative, physical, and technical controls, and can only be disclosed with patient authorization or for certain permitted purposes such as treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
  PHI includes but is not limited to:
  - **Spoken Word (Verbal)**: Conversations between healthcare providers or with patients
  - **Personal identifiers**: Name, address, birthdate, Social Security Number
  - **Medical records (Written)**: Notes, Diagnoses, treatment plans, lab results, prescriptions, faxes received
  - **Billing information**: Insurance details, account numbers, claims
  - **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** and any digital communication containing identifiable health information
  - **Other Electronic (ePHI)**: Emails, EHRs, text messages, or files stored on computers or mobile devices

- **NPI (National Provider Identifier)**: 10-digit number assigned to healthcare providers for standardized identification. Each covered entity may receive only one unique NPI, similar to a person's Social Security Number (SSN), and must be used for all standard transactions covered by HIPAA.
- **NPP (Notice of Privacy Practices)**: Outlines how patient info is used and protected; patients must sign acknowledgment, retained for 6 years from the date of creation or last date in effect (whichever is later) and usually means from the last date of service.

##### Restrictions, Violations, & Penalties

Under HIPAA, medical personnel cannot disclose any PHI to anyone other than the patient unless the patient has given express consent, including spouses & relatives. One such form of consent is a Release of Information form that is typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or to receive for their personal use. This includes accessing your own records without following proper protocol.

HIPAA violations (e.g., improper disclosure of PHI) must be reported to the **Office for Civil Rights** at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services:

- Within **60 days** of discovery if the breach affects **500 or more** people
- Annually (within 60 days of year-end) for smaller breaches

Patients have the right to obtain a copy of their healthcare records. If a patient asks for their records, you have 30 days to comply.

Offenses carried out with the intent to sell, transfer, or use the information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm can result in fines up to $250,000, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.

Violations due to reasonable cause and not willfull neglect can result in $1,000 to $50,000 fines.

> **NOTE** HIPAA allows the sharing of PHI under emergency situations such as natural disasters where people may be evacuated and require healthcare. Notice of disclosures still need to be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable after the emergency.

##### The Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act (HITECH, 2009)

- mends HIPAA to promote adoption and meaningful use of health information technology, including electronic prescribing & medical records
- set standards for the creation of these electronic systems
- expanded Covered Entities to include business associates

> ⚠️ Electronic transmission of health information, including claims and billing, must be done via HIPAA-compliant **electronic data interchange (EDI)**.

## Services Offered

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🔐 **HIPAA (1996)**: Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.

#### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. They usually contain inactive or weakened parts of a pathogen, or a genetic blueprint that prompts an immune response. Under normal ciscumstances, the **Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** publishes revised adult immunization schedules annually.

> **Herd Immunity** is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune. This is crucial to protecting **public health** by making it harder for pathogens to spread to those who are not vaccinated (like babies or the immunocompromised).

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is responsible for:

- Advising the CDC on national immunization policy
- Advising the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** on research priorities related to vaccines
- Establishing the vaccine antigen components for manufacturers
- Determining the legitimacy of any legal claims related to vaccines

📋 **Common Vaccines**

| Vaccine | Pathogen(s) | Frequency | Indications | Required in Healthcare? |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Flu** | Influenza (Multiple Strains) | Annual | All patients over 6 months or status unknown (regardless of health) | ✅ Yes (required during flu season) |
| **COVID-19** | SARS-CoV-2 | Annual or updated booster as recommended | Adults & Children | ✅ Yes (often required) |
| **MMR** | Measles, Mumps, Rubella | 2 doses (childhood); 1 booster for travel | Required for school; travel to endemic areas | ✅ Yes (2 documented doses or positive titer) |
| **Tdap** | Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis | Every 10 years (booster); during pregnancy | Adults every 10 years; pregnancy; wound care | ✅ Yes (1-time dose + boosters) |
| **Hepatitis B** | Hepatitis B virus | 2–3 dose series | Healthcare workers; infants; high-risk adults | ✅ Yes (OSHA-mandated) |
| **HPV** | Human papillomavirus | 2–3 doses depending on age | Preteens (ages 11–12); adults up to age 26 | ❌ No |
| **Varicella** | Varicella-zoster virus | 2 doses | Those without prior infection; school entry | ✅ Yes (or documented immunity) |
| **Meningococcal** | Neisseria meningitidis | 1–2 doses (some require boosters) | Teens; college students; military recruits | ⚠️ Conditional (recommended for lab workers) |

> 📌 **Note**: Vaccination schedules vary by age, health status, and exposure risk. Always consult the CDC immunization schedule.

In the U.S., there is an effective reminder system for childhood vaccinations, but adult immunizations are often overlooked due to the lack of consistent tracking or reminders. As of 2011, the pneumococcal vaccination rate was **62% for elderly adults** and only **20% for younger adults**.

Pharmacy technicians support immunization efforts by:

- ⚠️ **Identifying patients** eligible for recommended vaccines
- 🔢 **Entering vaccine prescriptions** and processing billing claims (especially through **Medicare Part D** and private insurers)
- 📄 Providing **CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS)** and collecting signed consent forms
- 🧊 Ensuring **cold chain compliance** by monitoring storage temperatures and logging refrigeration
- 📆 Assisting with **vaccine recordkeeping** and **appointment scheduling**

> ⚠️ **Tech Vaccine Authority**: In many states, technicians may administer certain vaccines after completing approved training programs and certification, per state board rules and under **HHS guidance** (especially during public health emergencies).

#### 🧪 Immunization Initiatives in Retail

💬 **Patient Conversations & Screening**

As the first point of contact in a pharmacy, technicians should be alert for opportunities to educate and screen patients. Start simple:

"**Have you had your flu shot this year?**"

> 🤧 Some patients believe the flu vaccine causes illness. You can clarify that protection takes ~2 weeks to develop and the vaccine itself doesn't cause the flu.

Use patient cues to suggest vaccine needs:

| Cue | Suggestion |
|-----|------------|
| 🍼 Buying baby supplies or mentions of pregnancy | Recommend **Tdap** and **flu** for pregnant individuals and close contacts. Pertussis and flu can be dangerous to newborns. |
| ✈️ Travel plans or purchase of motion sickness meds (e.g., Dramamine) | Suggest **Hepatitis A** vaccine—second only to travelers’ diarrhea for travel-related illness. |
| 🤧 Persistent cough or "whooping" sound | Raise the possibility of **pertussis** exposure; refer to pharmacist for evaluation. |
| 💉 Diabetic supply purchases | Screen for **flu**, **pneumococcal**, **Hepatitis B**, and **Tdap** vaccines. Diabetics are at higher risk for complications. |

> 💡 **Tip**: The **Immunization Action Coalition** (immunize.org) provides free tools for adult vaccine screening that pharmacy staff can use during patient intake.

#### 🧪 Immunization Initiatives in Hospitals

The **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** monitor hospital immunization practices, especially for **influenza** and **pneumococcal** vaccines. Hospitals that do not meet vaccination benchmarks may face **reduced reimbursement**.

##### 📋 Best Practices

Ideally, **influenza vaccination should be a standing order** for all admitted patients. If a patient refuses or has a temporary contraindication, they should be **reassessed later during their hospital stay**.

Key practices include:

- 💉 **Inactivated flu vaccines** should be easily accessible and properly stored throughout the hospital.
- 👩‍⚕️ Any qualified healthcare professional should be allowed to administer the flu vaccine when a patient meets eligibility criteria.
- 📤 **Flu vaccination should also be a standing discharge order** for all patients—regardless of their inpatient diagnosis.

**Pharmacy technicians** play a vital role in hospital immunization initiatives:

- 🧾 Check vaccine status during medication reconciliation or intake
- ⚠️ **Alert the pharmacist** when a high-risk patient is identified
- 🧊 Ensure proper vaccine storage conditions are maintained
- 📄 Assist in documenting vaccine refusals or contraindications

> ✅ Encouraging vaccination at every point of care helps reduce readmissions, improve outcomes, and support hospital reimbursement goals.

##### 🚨 High-Priority Patients

Patients with serious or chronic health conditions are at the **highest risk for flu and pneumonia complications**:

- **Diabetes**
- **Congestive heart failure** or other heart disease
- **Chronic kidney** or **liver disease**
- **Chronic lung disease** (especially asthma)
- **Immunocompromised patients** (due to illness or medication)
- **Tobacco smokers**

These patients should also be immunized against **pneumococcal disease**.

> 🧠 Patients with heart disease are **100× more likely** to require ICU care for pneumococcal infections.

The **Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)** recommends pneumococcal vaccination for **all adults age 65 and older** and for younger adults with certain medical conditions.

##### ⚠️ Vaccine Errors

Vaccine administration errors can pose serious safety risks and may lead to under-immunization, adverse effects, or loss of reimbursement. Technicians play a key role in preventing these errors by recognizing the most common causes:

- **Unclear or Unapproved Abbreviations**
  - Do **not** use vaccine abbreviations unless they are listed on the **CDC’s approved abbreviation list**.
  - ✅ This list should be **clearly posted** and accessible within the pharmacy.
- **Look-Alike / Sound-Alike Products**
  - ⚠️ *Tdap* (for **patients age 7 and older**) vs. *DTaP* (for **children under 7**).
  - Always verify **patient age** before selecting the correct product.
- **Confusing Brand Names**
  - Many vaccine brand names share similar endings, even when they treat different diseases:
    - **GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)** vaccines often end in **“-rix”** *(e.g., Shingrix, Infanrix, Engerix)*
    - **Merck** vaccines often end in **“-vax”** *(e.g., Varivax, Zostavax)*
      - ⚠️ **Zostavax** is **not approved for children** (do not confuse it with Varivax.)
- **Prescribing, Transcription, or Dispensing Errors**
  - Giving the **wrong dose** based on **patient age or weight**.
  - Failing to use the **correct formulation** for pediatric vs. adult patients.
  - Dispensing the wrong product due to similar packaging.

Vaccine safety starts with accurate communication and careful attention to detail—especially when working with similar-sounding products. Pharmacy technicians should:

- 📅 Always **verify patient age and weight** before processing a vaccine.
- 📦 **Check the package insert** every time a vaccine is dispensed to confirm proper:
  - Indication
  - Age range
  - Route and site of administration
- 💉 Use **unit-of-use syringes** when available to reduce the risk of dosing or labeling errors.

##### ❄️Vaccine Storage and Handling

Proper storage and handling of vaccines is **essential** to maintaining their safety and effectiveness. Vaccines that are exposed to incorrect temperatures may lose potency—even if they appear unchanged.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Vaccines that have been improperly stored **do not change color, smell, or appearance.** Visual inspection is not enough to confirm potency.

- **Immediately refrigerate or freeze** vaccines upon delivery, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
- Verify the **cold chain** was maintained during shipping (check temperature indicators or data loggers).
- Ensure vaccines are stored in:
  - A **dedicated medical-grade refrigerator or freezer** (not a household dorm fridge).
  - Clearly **labeled bins or baskets** to separate types and reduce mix-ups.
  - The **middle of the unit** (not in the door or directly against the back wall).
- **Log temperatures twice daily** using a calibrated thermometer or digital data logger.
- **Do not administer** any vaccine that may have been exposed to:
  - Incorrect temperatures
  - Light damage (for light-sensitive vaccines)
  - Expired storage conditions
  - Physical contamination

💡 **Tips for Safe Vaccine Storage**

- Always **check expiration dates** before storing or dispensing.
- Rotate stock: **"First In, First Out" (FIFO)** method.
- Post a **vaccine storage chart** (e.g., CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit) near the fridge.
- Maintain an **emergency plan** for power outages or equipment failure.
