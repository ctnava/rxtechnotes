## ðŸ“š United States Pharmacopeiaâ€“National Formulary (USPâ€“NF)

The **USPâ€“NF** is an official compendium of drug standards used in the United States. It is published by the **United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)** and recognized by the U.S. **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** as an enforceable standard under the **Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act**.

The USPâ€“NF is actually two works combined into one:

| Component  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **USP (United States Pharmacopeia)** | Standards for **medicines**, **dosage forms**, **drug substances**, **excipients**, and **nutritional supplements**. |
| **NF (National Formulary)** | Standards for **inactive ingredients** (excipients), such as binders, fillers, preservatives, and flavorings. |

Together, the USPâ€“NF provides quality standards to ensure:

- Identity
- Strength
- Purity
- Packaging and labeling
- Storage and handling

All prescription and OTC medications sold in the U.S. must comply with applicable USPâ€“NF standards if they are labeled as such. Pharmacies and manufacturers must use USPâ€“NF to ensure that compounded and commercial drugs meet national safety and quality standards. Many states require compounded medications to comply with USP chapters such as:

- <795> Nonsterile Compounding
- <797> Sterile Compounding
- <800> Hazardous Drugs Handling
- <1075> Good Compounding Practices

While USP is a **non-governmental organization**, its standards are **legally enforceable** by the FDA. Drugs failing to meet USPâ€“NF standards are considered **adulterated** or **misbranded** under federal law.

> ðŸ§  **Quick Fact**: The USPâ€“NF is updated annually, with two supplemental updates each year to reflect evolving scientific standards.

## ðŸ’§ Common IV Solutions

| Abbreviation | Full Name  | Composition | Osmolarity (Relative to Blood) | Clinical Use / Indication | Special Considerations |
|--------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| NS | Normal Saline | 0.9% Sodium Chloride in Water | Isotonic | Hydration, fluid resuscitation, compatible with most meds, drug administration, surgical irrigation, commonly used in surgery, trauma, and emergency situations | Can cause hyperchloremic acidosis with large volumes, not ideal for patients with conditions like heart failure due to sodium content |
| 1/2NS | Half Normal Saline | 0.45% Sodium Chloride in Water | Hypotonic | Maintenance fluids, chronic dehydration, hypertonic dehydration, used for hydration when less sodium is needed | Avoid in head trauma or hyponatremia, not suitable for resuscitation, caution in patietnts with liver disease as it can exacerbate fluid shifts |
| D5W | 5% Dextrose in Water | 5g Dextrose per 100mL Water | Isotonic* â†’ Hypotonic in body | Treat hypoglycemia, provide calories for patients who cannot eat, Hydration, diluent for certain medications | Avoid in diabetics; becomes hypotonic after metabolism, not a source of electrolytes |
| D5NS | Dextrose 5% in 0.9% Sodium Chloride | 5g Dextrose + 0.9% NaCl per 100mL Water | Hypertonic | Provides calories and sodium; treat hypoglycemia, used post-op or for NPO pts | Monitor for fluid overload; avoid in renal or cardiac pts |
| LR (RL) | Lactated Ringerâ€™s Solution | NaCl, KCl, CaClâ‚‚, Sodium Lactate in Water | Isotonic | fluid replacement with hydration and glucose, acute blood loss, used in surgery, trauma, & burn recovery, corrects metabolic acidosis | Contains potassiumâ€”use cautiously in renal failure |
| SW or SWFI | Sterile Water for Injection | Sterile Water (no solutes) | Hypotonic | Used to dilute or reconstitute medications, irrigation of wounds | NEVER give IV pushâ€”risk of hemolysis |

> *D5W is isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic once glucose is metabolized.
