# Compounded Medications

## 📚 United States Pharmacopeia–National Formulary (USP–NF)

The **USP–NF** is an official compendium of drug standards used in the United States. It is published by the **United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)** and recognized by the U.S. **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** as an enforceable standard under the **Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act**.

The USP–NF is actually two works combined into one:

| Component  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **USP (United States Pharmacopeia)** | Standards for **medicines**, **dosage forms**, **drug substances**, **excipients**, and **nutritional supplements**. |
| **NF (National Formulary)** | Standards for **inactive ingredients** (excipients), such as binders, fillers, preservatives, and flavorings. |

Together, the USP–NF provides quality standards to ensure:

- Identity
- Strength
- Purity
- Packaging and labeling
- Storage and handling

All prescription and OTC medications sold in the U.S. must comply with applicable USP–NF standards if they are labeled as such. Pharmacies and manufacturers must use USP–NF to ensure that compounded and commercial drugs meet national safety and quality standards. Many states require compounded medications to comply with USP chapters such as:

- <795> Nonsterile Compounding
- <797> Sterile Compounding
- <800> Hazardous Drugs Handling
- <1075> Good Compounding Practices

While USP is a **non-governmental organization**, its standards are **legally enforceable** by the FDA. Drugs failing to meet USP–NF standards are considered **adulterated** or **misbranded** under federal law.

> 🧠 **Quick Fact**: The USP–NF is updated annually, with two supplemental updates each year to reflect evolving scientific standards.

## 💉 Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)

Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs) are medications mixed or prepared in a **sterile environment** using **aseptic techniques** to prevent contamination with microorganisms, pyrogens, or particulate matter. These are most often administered via **injection, infusion, or irrigation**, making sterility critical.

CSPs are regulated under **USP <797>**.

### 🧪 Sterile Compounding Environment

Sterile compounding must take place in a **cleanroom suite** or **segregated compounding area (SCA)** using:

- **Laminar airflow workbenches (LAFW)**
- **Biological safety cabinets (BSC)**
- **Compounding aseptic isolators (CAIs)**
- Controlled **ISO-classified environments** (ISO 5 or better for critical areas)

> 📌 *All sterile compounding requires strict aseptic technique.*

### 🏷️ CSP Labeling Requirements

All compounded sterile products must include:

- ✅ Patient name (if patient-specific)
- ✅ Drug name and **concentration/strength**
- ✅ Total volume and base solution
- ✅ Route and rate of administration (e.g., IVPB over 30 mins)
- ✅ **Beyond-use date (BUD)** and time (not the manufacturer’s expiration date)
- ✅ Storage requirements (e.g., refrigerate, room temp)
- ✅ Initials of compounding and verifying personnel

> 📌 *CSPs use a BUD assigned based on stability and USP <797> risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High risk).*

### 🩸 IV Solutions and Admixtures

**Intravenous (IV) solutions** are a common type of CSP, used to:

- Hydrate patients
- Deliver medications (e.g., antibiotics, pain meds, chemotherapy)
- Provide nutrition (**TPN** for NPO or critically ill patients)
- Replace or balance electrolytes (e.g., sodium chloride, potassium chloride)

IV admixtures are prepared for specific patients based on:

- Weight or body surface area (BSA)
- Fluid restrictions
- Lab values (e.g., sodium, creatinine, glucose)

> 🧠 *Admixtures are customized for clinical need and economic practicality. Bulk production is not feasible.*

🔍 **Technician Responsibilities**

Pharmacy technicians involved in sterile compounding must:

- Complete **initial and annual training/competency evaluations**
- Pass **media fill tests** and **gloved fingertip testing**
- Perform accurate calculations and measurements
- Prepare products under pharmacist supervision using **cleanroom protocol**
- Maintain proper **hand hygiene, garbing, and environmental cleaning**

🛡️ **Final Product Checks**

Every CSP must be verified by a pharmacist before dispensing. Checks include:

- Correct **drug and dose**
- Compatibility and **physical stability** (e.g., absence of precipitation)
- Proper **labeling** and documentation
- Compliance with BUD and storage requirements

> 🚨 *Any visible contamination, cloudiness, or color change renders the product unfit for use.*

#### 💧 Common IV Solutions & Uses

| Abbreviation | Full Name  | Composition | Osmolarity (Relative to Blood) | Clinical Use / Indication | Special Considerations |
|--------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| NS | Normal Saline | 0.9% Sodium Chloride in Water | Isotonic | Hydration, fluid resuscitation, compatible with most meds, drug administration, surgical irrigation, commonly used in surgery, trauma, and emergency situations | Can cause hyperchloremic acidosis with large volumes, not ideal for patients with conditions like heart failure due to sodium content |
| 1/2NS | Half Normal Saline | 0.45% Sodium Chloride in Water | Hypotonic | Maintenance fluids, chronic dehydration, hypertonic dehydration, used for hydration when less sodium is needed | Avoid in head trauma or hyponatremia, not suitable for resuscitation, caution in patietnts with liver disease as it can exacerbate fluid shifts |
| D5W | 5% Dextrose in Water | 5g Dextrose per 100mL Water | Isotonic* → Hypotonic in body | Treat hypoglycemia, provide calories for patients who cannot eat, Hydration, diluent for certain medications | Avoid in diabetics; becomes hypotonic after metabolism, not a source of electrolytes |
| D5NS | Dextrose 5% in 0.9% Sodium Chloride | 5g Dextrose + 0.9% NaCl per 100mL Water | Hypertonic | Provides calories and sodium; treat hypoglycemia, used post-op or for NPO pts | Monitor for fluid overload; avoid in renal or cardiac pts |
| LR (RL) | Lactated Ringer’s Solution | NaCl, KCl, CaCl₂, Sodium Lactate in Water | Isotonic | fluid replacement with hydration and glucose, acute blood loss, used in surgery, trauma, & burn recovery, corrects metabolic acidosis | Contains potassium—use cautiously in renal failure |
| SW or SWFI | Sterile Water for Injection | Sterile Water (no solutes) | Hypotonic | Used to dilute or reconstitute medications, irrigation of wounds | NEVER give IV push—risk of hemolysis |

> *D5W is isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic once glucose is metabolized.
