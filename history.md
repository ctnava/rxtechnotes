# Introduction to Pharmacy

**Pharmacology** is the study of how drugs interact with biological systems, including their effects, mechanisms of action, metabolism, and excretion.

It differs from:

- **Pharmacognosy**, which focuses on drugs from natural sources, and
- **Pharmaceutics**, which focuses on formulation and delivery of drug products.
