# Chapter 3: Dispensing Marketing Drugs

The **Durham-Humphrey Amendment** (1951) amendment established two classes of drugs: *legend* & *over-the-counter* (OTC).

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
- **Legend**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription".
- **Over-the-Counter(OTC)**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use. OTC drugs are not inherently safe because they may have significant drug interactions with prescription medications. Technicians must refer patients who request them to pharmacists.

## Controlled (& Listed) Subtances

## Formularies

**Formularies** (i.e. a list of drugs approved and made available for use) are often used to decide which medications to dispense to patients. In a hospital setting, it refers to drugs that are stocked by the pharmacy and approved for use in the facility. In retail, it refers to an approved drug list associated with a particular insurance benefit plan. In every case, every drug is identified by their 11-digit NDC.

### Generic Substitution

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.
