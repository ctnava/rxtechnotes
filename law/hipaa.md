# Health Information Privacy

## Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996)

<!-- Regulating how Covered Entities handle Protected Health Information (PHI) -->

HIPAA was originally enacted to protect individuals' access to health insurance when changing jobs or living with pre-existing conditions. It has since evolved into a broad federal standard for the protection of **Protected Health Information (PHI)** and governs how healthcare providers, insurers, and other entities handle patient information.

### 🔑 Primary Objectives

- Maintain continuity of health insurance coverage
- Standardize electronic health transactions
- Reduce administrative fraud and burden on consumers
- Protect patient health information from misuse, theft, or inappropriate disclosure

> 📌 HIPAA is enforced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), primarily through the **Office for Civil Rights (OCR)**.

### 🔗 Covered Entities

**Covered Entities** are subject to HIPAA because they transmit health information (*in any form*) in connection with standard transactions. They include:

- **Healthcare Providers**: Physicians, clinics, hospitals, pharmacists, pharmacies
- **Health Plans**: Insurers, employer-sponsored plans, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid
- **Healthcare Clearinghouses**: Third parties that process nonstandard data into standard formats

> 🛡️ Business Associates (e.g. billing services, IT contractors) are regulated under HITECH.

### 🕵️‍♀️ Protected Health Information (PHI)

PHI refers to any information, in any form, that can identify a patient and relates to their health status (*past, present, or future*), healthcare services, or payment. This includes:

- **Verbal**: oral communications or information (e.g. conversations about care or billing)
- **Paper Documents**: written communications or information (e.g. Charts, faxes, prescriptions, printouts)
- **Electronic (ePHI)**: digital communications or information (e.g. Emails, EHRs, cloud storage, mobile devices)
- **Identifiers**: in any form (e.g. Name, DOB, address, SSN, MRN, phone number, photographs)

> 🚨 PHI remains protected **50 years after death** unless an exception applies.

### 🔓 HIPAA Privacy Rule

- **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**:
  - Informs patients of their rights and how PHI is used
  - Patients must acknowledge receipt
  - Retention: 6 years from date of signature or last effective date.
- **Disclosure Protocol**: PHI may only be used or disclosed for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO) without patient authorization.
- **Minimum Necessary Rule**: Disclose only the least amount of PHI required for the purpose; keeping disclosures on a “need to know” basis and gathering the minimum amount of data.
- **Authorization Required**: For marketing, research, or sharing with third parties not involved in TPO.
- **National Provider Identifier**: A 10-digit, unique ID assigned to each covered provider. Required on all HIPAA-compliant transactions.

#### 🧾 Release of Information (ROI)

Patient authorization for PHI disclosure must be documented via a **valid ROI form**. Valid authorization includes:

- Specific description of the information
- Name of recipient
- Expiration date or event
- Signature and date

> 📌 Typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or patient personal use

### 🛡️ HIPAA Security Rule

Applies specifically to **ePHI** and mandates layered safeguards:

- **Administrative**: Employ written policies, SOPs, training, & security officers.
- **Technical**: Includes cybersecurity protocols & digital hygiene; access controls, audit logs, encryption.
- **Physical**: Know “who belongs where and when” and keeping PHI in locked file cabinets. Access is gatekept by badges and keeping workstations secure.

> 📌 HIPAA requires **role-based access** to PHI. Personnel must have access only to what they need to do their job.

### 💊 Pharmacy-Specific HIPAA Requirements

Pharmacies must:

- Train staff on HIPAA at regular intervals
- Post and offer patients a Notice of Privacy Practices
- Provide access to PHI upon request (within 30 days)
- Appoint a **Privacy Officer** and maintain written policies
- Shred, de-identify, or securely dispose of all PHI
- Prevent unauthorized verbal disclosure (including casual conversations)

> 🚨 HIPAA prohibits disclosure of PHI to family or spouses without patient authorization. Exception: if the patient is present and does not object, or if professional judgment determines it is in the patient's best interest.

### ⚠️ Violations & Penalties

#### 🛑 Common Violations

- Sharing PHI (e.g. with spouses and relatives) without **express consent** from the patient
- Discussing PHI in public areas (i.e. **gossip**)
- Accessing a patient’s chart without a valid reason
- Disposing of printed PHI in regular trash
- Failing to encrypt portable devices

> - 📌 Being in contact with PHI means that you are now governed under HIPAA
> - 🚨 While not *technically* a violation, accessing your own records without following proper protocol is considered bad practice

#### 📅 Breach Notification Rule

- **≥ 500 affected**: Notify OCR, affected individuals, and local media within **60 days**
- **< 500 affected**: Log and report to OCR **annually**

#### 💸 Civil & Criminal Penalties

| Violation Type | Penalty |
|----------------|---------|
| Unknowing | $100 to $50,000 per violation |
| Reasonable Cause | $1,000 to $50,000 |
| Willful Neglect (Corrected) | $10,000 to $50,000 |
| Willful Neglect (Uncorrected) | Minimum $50,000 |
| Knowingly misusing PHI | Up to $250,000 + up to 10 years in prison |

> ✅ Penalties are based on **harm caused**, **intent**, and **effort to correct** the violation.

#### 🚨 Special Situations

- **Emergencies & Disasters**: PHI may be shared for care coordination, family notification, and to reduce risk, but must still follow the “minimum necessary” standard. Privacy notices must be delivered as soon as practical.
- **Incidental Disclosures**: Not a violation if reasonable safeguards are in place (e.g., overheard info at a pharmacy counter with barriers).

## Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act (HITECH, 2009)

<!-- Amends HIPAA -->

- Expands HIPAA by extending accountability to **Business Associates**
- Promotes **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** and defines **Meaningful Use** standards
- Requires secure **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** for billing and records
- Increases penalties for non-compliance

> 🤯 HITECH ties HIPAA compliance to federal incentive programs for technology adoption and mandates stricter breach reporting.
