# Miscellaneous Law

## Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

Ensures workplace safety nationwide. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

> ⚠️ Chemotherapy agents and other hazardous drugs must have Safety Data Sheets!

## Red Flag Rule (2007)

The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** established the Red Flag Rule to combat **identity theft** in financial and healthcare institutions, including **pharmacies** that maintain **billing accounts** for patients.

Pharmacies that meet the FTC's definition of a **creditor** (e.g. by allowing patients to pay in installments or billing later) are required to:

- Develop and implement an **Identity Theft Prevention Program**
- Establish procedures to:
  - Detect suspicious activity or **"red flags"** during patient verification
  - Prevent and mitigate identity theft
  - Respond appropriately when red flags are identified
- Train staff on how to recognize and report red flags

> 🛡️ The Red Flag Rule applies when a pharmacy **bills insurance or offers credit** and retains patient data. Failure to comply may result in fines or legal action.
