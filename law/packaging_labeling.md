# Extended Packaging & Labeling Policy

## Fair Packaging & Labeling Act (FPLA, 1967)

The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) requires all consumer products (including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and many prescription drug packages) to bear labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand. Enforced by the FDA (for food, drugs, cosmetics) and the FTC (for other consumer goods), this act ensures transparency and prevents deceptive packaging.

Under the FPLA, drug packaging must include:

- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- An accurate statement of the quantity of the contents (by weight, measure, or count)
- A clear declaration of the product’s identity and intended use

These requirements complement the FDA’s misbranding and labeling rules under the FDCA and ensure consumers receive consistent and honest information, regardless of brand.

> 📌 The FPLA helps prevent misbranding by requiring clarity and standardization in labeling. Technicians must ensure that OTC products and bulk containers are correctly labeled before stocking shelves or filling orders.

## Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA, 1970)

The PPPA was enacted to reduce the risk of accidental poisoning in children under five years of age by requiring **child-resistant (CR) packaging** for hazardous household substances, including many prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.

> 🔑 **Enforced by** the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), not the FDA.

### Requirements

- **Child-resistant packaging** must be used for most prescription drugs dispensed to patients.
- CR packaging must be designed so that at least **85% of children under five cannot open it**, while **90% of adults can**.
- **Reversible (dual-purpose)** caps are allowed but must default to the child-resistant mode unless otherwise requested.

### Exceptions (Exemptions from CR packaging)

CR packaging is *not required* in the following cases:

- 🩺 **Upon prescriber request** (for a single prescription only)
- 🩺 **Upon patient request** (can apply to all prescriptions; must be documented)
- 💸 Certain OTC products, such as:
  - Effervescent acetaminophen or aspirin tablets (with low unit content)
  - Powdered iron or acetaminophen formulations with ≤0.324 g per unit dose
- Institutional settings where medications are administered by professionals (e.g. nursing homes, hospitals)
- Specific medications by regulation, such as:
  - **Emergency Medication** (e.g. Sublingual nitroglycerin)
  - **Oral contraceptives** in mnemonic blister packs
  - **Inhalers** (e.g., albuterol)
  - **Prepackaged Medications**

### Technician Responsibilities

- Ensure that dispensed containers use CR packaging by default.
- If a **non-CR container** is requested:
  - 🩺 Record the request clearly in the patient's profile.
  - Only fulfill prescriber-requested exceptions **per individual prescription**.
- Do **not reuse** child-resistant containers. The mechanism may degrade after use.
- Maintain awareness of which medications are **exempt** from CR requirements.

> - 🛡️ Failing to use child-resistant packaging without proper documentation may result in **liability** for preventable harm.
> - 🚨 CR requirements apply at the **point of dispensing**, not necessarily at the manufacturer level. A product may arrive in CR packaging and still require repackaging at the pharmacy.

## Drug Listing Act (1972)

The Drug Listing Act of 1972 mandates that all drug establishments provide a complete list of drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for distribution, and these drugs must have a ***11-digit National Drug Code (NDC)***; a 3-segmented universal identifier.

| Segment | Digits | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Labeler Code | 5 | Identifies the manufacturer or distributor (FDA-assigned) |
| Product Code | 4 | Identifies drug, strength, and dosage form (Manufacturer-assigned) |
| Package Code | 2 | Identifies package size and type (Manufacturer-assigned) |

> 📌 NDCs can appear as 10-digit variations on packaging. For databases and claims, they are normalized to **11-digit** format with leading zeros (e.g. `0517-0420-01` ➡ `00517-0420-01`).
> .
> 🤯 NATO Stock Number (NSN) is the military analog to the NDC.

## 🤯 Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA, 2013)

The DSCSA aims to improve the security and traceability of prescription drugs in the supply chain by facilitating a more seamless flow of data between supply chain partners. This protects patients from harmful drugs, including counterfeit, stolen, or contaminated medications.

- **Product Identification**: All prescription drugs must be labeled with a unique product identifier, including a Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN), serial number, lot number, and expiration date.
  - **Matrix Barcode (2D) Mandate**: Requires the use of 2D barcodes, specifically GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, on the unit of sale (UoS) packaging of prescription drugs.
- **Tracing**: Detailed transaction information, history, and statements must be maintained and shared electronically to trace drugs throughout the supply chain.
- **Verification**: Drug identifiers must be verified at various points in the supply chain to ensure their authenticity and prevent illegitimate products from entering the system.
- **Notification**: Trading partners must notify the FDA and other involved parties within 24 hours of discovering an illegitimate or high-risk product.
- **Interoperable Systems**: The law mandates the development of an electronic, interoperable system for tracking drugs from manufacturer to dispenser.
- **Enforcement**: The FDA has been implementing the DSCSA since 2013, and enforcement began in 2025.
