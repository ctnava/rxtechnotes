# 🦅 Abbreviated Federal Law Reference Guide

## 340B Drug Pricing Program (340B, 1992)

340B allows certain hospitals and other healthcare providers, known as "covered entities," to purchase outpatient drugs at discounted prices from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This program is intended to help "stretch scarce federal resources" and improve access to medications for vulnerable populations.

Covered entities include:

- hospitals that receive financial assistance under the Public Health Service Act
- certain federally qualified health centers (FQHCs)
- other providers serving underserved populations

Manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program are required to offer discounted prices on covered outpatient drugs to participating 340B entities.

## Healthcare Coverage & Standards of Care

### Social Security Act Amendments (1965)

These amendments to the Social Security Act created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C where it may act as an HMO or PPO offered by private insurers.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

> 🤯 The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010) was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

## Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)

OBRA-90 was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> 📍 Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

A process to ensure the most accurate, complete list of all medications a patient is taking—name, dose, route, and frequency—by comparing current medical records with patient and provider sources.  

Especially critical for:

- Emergency Department admissions
- Hospitalist-managed patients
- Patients with **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
- Transfers from **Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**

## Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)

The MMA established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> 📍 MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 📨 **HIPAA**: Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.

## Workplace Safety

### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
