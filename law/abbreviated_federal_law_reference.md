# 🦅 Abbreviated Federal Law Reference Guide

## Pure Food, Drugs, & Cosmetics Act (FDC, 1906)

- Prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated or misbranded food and drugs
- Required government preapproval of drugs before marketing or sale
- Enforced by the Bureau of Chemistry (precursor to the FDA) until the Food, Drug, & Insecticide Administration was formed in 1927 and rebranded as the FDA in 1930.

## Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA, 1938)

- Required that new drugs must be proven **safe** before marketing.
- Passed after the **sulfanilamide** tragedy, which caused over 100 deaths (many of which were children) after using this drug in an oral tablet dosage form

> **Note**: Thalidomide is now FDA-approved for treating multiple myeloma and leprosy. Use requires strict risk acknowledgment from both men and women.

## Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951)

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
- **Legend**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription" or "RX Only".
- **Over-the-Counter(OTC)**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use.

## Kefauver-Harris Amendment (1962)

- Required that new drugs must also be proven **effective**
- Passed after the **thalidomide** tragedy, which caused severe birth defects in pregnant women when it was used as a sleeping pill without any warnings
- Reinforced by Alberty Food Products v. US (1950), which required labeling intended use.

> 🤯 In 1976, the Medical Device Regulation Act (or "Medical Device Amendments") established the framework for regulating medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness. This means pre-market approval is required for life-sustaining and life-supporting medical devices (Class III).

## Social Security Act Amendments (1965)

These amendments to the Social Security Act created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C where it may act as an HMO or PPO offered by private insurers.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

## Fair Packaging & Labeling Act (FPLA, 1967)

The FPLA requires all consumer products (including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and many prescription drug packages) to bear labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand; ensuring transparency and the prevention of deceptive packaging.

Enforced by:

- **FDA**: food, drugs, cosmetics  
- **FTC**: other consumer goods

Requires that drug packaging includes:

- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- An accurate statement of the quantity of the contents (by weight, measure, or count)
- A clear declaration of the product’s identity and intended use

> 📌 Helps prevent misbranding and supports FDCA compliance.
> ✅ Technicians must verify that **bulk containers and OTC products** are properly labeled before stocking or use.

## Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

Ensures workplace safety. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

> ⚠️ Chemotherapy agents and other hazardous drugs must have Safety Data Sheets!

## Drug Listing Act (1972)

The Drug Listing Act of 1972 mandates that all drug establishments provide a complete list of drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for distribution, and these drugs must have a ***11-digit National Drug Code (NDC)***; a 3-segmented universal identifier.

| Segment        | Digits | Description                                              |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Labeler Code   | 5      | Identifies the manufacturer or distributor (FDA-assigned) |
| Product Code   | 4      | Identifies drug, strength, and dosage form               |
| Package Code   | 2      | Identifies package size and type                         |

> 📌 NDCs can appear as 10-digit variations on packaging. For databases and claims, they are normalized to **11-digit** format with leading zeros (e.g. `0517-0420-01` ➡ `00517-0420-01`).
> 🤯 NATO Stock Number (NSN) is the military analog to the NDC.

## Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA, 1987)

The PDMA primarily aims to protect public health by regulating the distribution of prescription drugs and samples. It prevents the sale of counterfeit, adulterated, or subpotent drugs by mandating that:

- **Wholesalers** must be licensed by the state they operate in and meet uniform standards.
- **Wholesalers** may not reimport batches of prescription drugs manufactured in the US and exported abroad back into the US; preventing the entry of potentially compromised or counterfeit drugs.
- **Wholesalers** & **Manufacturers** may only provide medication samples to licensed prescribers upon request and with proper record-keeping; preventing the illegal sale of samples.

## 340B Drug Pricing Program (340B, 1992)

340B allows certain hospitals and other healthcare providers, known as "covered entities," to purchase outpatient drugs at discounted prices from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This program is intended to help "stretch scarce federal resources" and improve access to medications for vulnerable populations.

Covered entities include:

- hospitals that receive financial assistance under the Public Health Service Act
- certain federally qualified health centers (FQHCs)
- other providers serving underserved populations

Manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program are required to offer discounted prices on covered outpatient drugs to participating 340B entities.

## Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010)

The Obamacare was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

## Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA, 2013)

The DSCSA aims to improve the security and traceability of prescription drugs in the supply chain.

### 🎯 DSCSA Objectives

- **Patient Safety**: Protecting patients from harmful drugs, including counterfeit, stolen, or contaminated medications.
- **Drug Supply Chain Security**: Enhancing the security of the drug supply chain by making it more difficult for illegitimate products to enter.
- **Data Exchange**: Facilitating a more seamless flow of data between supply chain partners.

### 🔑 DSCSA Key Features

- **Product Identification**: All prescription drugs must be labeled with a unique product identifier, including a Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN), serial number, lot number, and expiration date.
  - **Matrix Barcode (2D) Mandate**: Requires the use of 2D barcodes, specifically GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, on the unit of sale (UoS) packaging of prescription drugs.
- **Tracing**: Detailed transaction information, history, and statements must be maintained and shared electronically to trace drugs throughout the supply chain.
- **Verification**: Drug identifiers must be verified at various points in the supply chain to ensure their authenticity and prevent illegitimate products from entering the system.
- **Notification**: Trading partners must notify the FDA and other involved parties within 24 hours of discovering an illegitimate or high-risk product.
- **Interoperable Systems**: The law mandates the development of an electronic, interoperable system for tracking drugs from manufacturer to dispenser.
- **Enforcement**: The FDA has been implementing the DSCSA since 2013, and enforcement began in 2025.
