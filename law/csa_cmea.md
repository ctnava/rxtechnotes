# DEA Policy

## 🔐 Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 1970)

The ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 1970)*** classifies five levels of controlled substances that have potential for abuse and therefore restricts their distribution. These five categories are called "schedules" and are determined based on potential for abuse, medical use, and risk to overall safety. Drugs placed in Schedules I–V are controlled substances and are subject to varying degrees of regulation regarding prescribing, dispensing, and recordkeeping.

> **TRIVIA**: The Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990 added anabolic steroids (like testosterone) to Schedule III of the CSA.

| Schedule | Mark | 🧾 Description | 💊 Examples | 🔁 Prescribing Restrictions |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 🟥 I      | C-I  | 🚫 No accepted medical use, 🆙 high abuse potential | Heroin, LSD, Ecstasy (MDMA), Cannabis* | ❌ **Not allowed** — Cannot be prescribed |
| 🟥 II     | C-II | ✅ Accepted medical use, 🆙 high abuse risk, severe dependence | Oxycodone (opioid), Methadone (opioid), Fentanyl (opioid), Adderall (most stimulants) | ⛔ **No refills allowed** — New Rx required each time; prescriptions valid for 30 days; prescriptions valid for 30 days to 6 months |

#### DEA Form 222

DEA Form 222 is used to order, transfer, or return **only** Schedule II controlled substances.

It is a *triplicate form* (in traditional paper format), though many pharmacies now use the ***Controlled Substance Ordering System (CSOS)*** for digital ordering.

| Copy       | Color | Recipient                              |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Copy 1** | Brown | **Supplier** keeps                     |
| **Copy 2** | Green | Sent by the supplier to the **DEA**    |
| **Copy 3** | Blue  | **Pharmacy (purchaser)** keeps on file |

- The pharmacy must keep Copy 3 and a record of the quantity received and the date received.
- All copies must be kept on file for 2 years federally (California requires 3 years). **Schedule II records must be kept for 7 years**.
- If a DEA Form 222 is voided, incomplete, or has errors, it must be marked void and retained—never destroyed.
- In CSOS (electronic format), each order is digitally signed and tracked, with strict encryption and audit trails.

> 🔐 Schedule II records must be kept separate from all other controlled substance records and must be readily retrievable for DEA audits.

### 💼 Prescriber & Pharmacy Responsibilities

- A **valid DEA number** is required on all prescriptions for controlled substances.
  - 🔗 [Verifying DEA Numbers](../math/dea_numbers.md)
- Schedule II prescriptions must be written (or e-prescribed where required) and cannot be refilled.
- Partial fills of C-II prescriptions are allowed if requested by the prescriber or patient:
  - The initial partial fill must occur within 30 days of the issue date.
  - The remainder must be filled within that same 30-day window; otherwise, the prescription expires.
- Schedule II records must be stored separately from all others.
- Schedule III–V records must also be maintained separately and be readily retrievable.

> **Joint Responsibility**: By law, both the prescripter and dispenser of the prescription have joint responsibility and liability for the legitimate medical purpose of a prescription.

### 🗃️ Recordkeeping Requirements (CA Laws Referenced)

- All prescription and dispensing records for controlled substances must be stored on-site for at least 3 years (CA B&P Code § 4333). **Schedule II records must be kept for 7 years.**
- Inventory audits must be conducted every 2 years (CA H&S Code § 11190) and must include:
  - Drug name, dosage form, and strength
  - Quantity on hand
  - Date and time of inventory
  - Signature of the responsible pharmacist

### ⚠️ Dispensing & Monitoring Duties

- Schedule II prescriptions generally require a written or e-prescription, except in emergencies:
  - A verbal or faxed order may be accepted temporarily, but a written/electronic Rx must follow within 7 days.
- Pharmacies must maintain dispensing logs for all refills and ensure proper dispensing and recordkeeping.

It is the pharmacy staff’s responsibility to:

- Verify and log all controlled substance prescriptions
- Monitor for abuse or diversion
- Ensure compliance with all state and federal regulations

## 🧪 Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA, 2005)
