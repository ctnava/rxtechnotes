# Healthcare Policy

## Social Security Act Amendments (1965)

These amendments to the Social Security Act created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C where it may act as an HMO or PPO offered by private insurers.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

> 🤯 The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010) was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

## Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)

OBRA-90 was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> 📍 Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

A process to ensure the most accurate, complete list of all medications a patient is taking—name, dose, route, and frequency—by comparing current medical records with patient and provider sources.  

Especially critical for:

- Emergency Department admissions
- Hospitalist-managed patients
- Patients with **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
- Transfers from **Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**

## Public Health Service Act (PHSA, 1944; 340B in 1992)

The **Public Health Service Act (PHSA)** is a foundational federal statute that governs public health and service delivery in the United States. Originally enacted in 1944 and heavily amended since, it authorizes and organizes federal public health and medical response capabilities, research funding, and service-based health programs.

- 🤯 **Title III – National Research Institutes (e.g., NIH, NCI)**  
  Authorizes funding and oversight for medical research through the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**. Supports the development of new therapies, clinical trials, and drug innovation—many of which later affect pharmacy practice via new drug approvals and REMS programs.
- 🤯 **Title II – Communicable Disease Control**  
  Grants authority to the CDC and other agencies to track, investigate, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Pharmacists and technicians may be involved in **emergency vaccine administration**, **drug stockpile deployment**, or **testing logistics** under this provision.
- 🤯 **Title V – Health Services for Disadvantaged Populations**  
  Supports maternal and child health programs, substance use disorder treatment, rural health initiatives, and minority health services—all of which may affect drug access, formulary design, and compliance protocols in ambulatory settings.
- 📌 **Section 340B – Drug Pricing Program**: 340B allows certain hospitals and other healthcare providers, known as "covered entities," to purchase outpatient drugs at discounted prices from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This program is intended to help "stretch scarce federal resources" and improve access to medications for vulnerable populations.

Covered entities include:

- **Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSHs)**
- **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)**
- **Other providers serving underserved populations**
  - Ryan White HIV/AIDS grantees
  - Hemophilia treatment centers
  - Title X family planning clinics
  - Tribal and Urban Indian health organizations
  - Certain children’s hospitals and critical access hospitals

Manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program are required to offer discounted prices on covered outpatient drugs to participating 340B entities.

> 🦅 Manufacturers **must** participate in 340B as a condition of their involvement in the **Medicaid Drug Rebate Program**.
> .
> 🛡️ Covered entities are **strictly prohibited** from diverting discounted drugs to ineligible patients and must avoid **duplicate discounts** (i.e., receiving both a Medicaid rebate and a 340B discount on the same drug).

## Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)

The MMA established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> 📍 MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 🛡️ HIPAA Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.
