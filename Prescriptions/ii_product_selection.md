# 📘 Appendix II: Product Selection Codes

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.

🧾 **DAW Codes Reference Table**

| **DAW Code** | **Meaning** | **When It’s Used** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **0** | No product selection indicated | Default; no DAW—generic substitution is allowed and expected. |
| **1** | Substitution not allowed by prescriber | Prescriber wants **brand only** (e.g., writes “Brand Medically Necessary”). |
| **2** | Substitution allowed—patient requested brand | Patient chooses **brand name** even though generic is available. |
| **3** | Substitution allowed—pharmacist selected brand | Pharmacist dispenses brand when generic is available (rarely reimbursed). |
| **4** | Substitution allowed—generic not in stock | Temporary situation; brand dispensed because pharmacy is out of generic. |
| **5** | Substitution allowed—brand dispensed as generic | Brand dispensed but billed as generic (often due to labeling agreements). |
| **6** | Override | Used in special cases where substitution rules are overridden (e.g., plan override, emergency). |
| **7** | Substitution not allowed—brand mandated by law | Certain drugs must be dispensed as brand per state law (e.g., anticonvulsants in some states). |
| **8** | Substitution allowed—generic not available in marketplace | No generic product exists yet, so brand must be used. |
| **9** | Other | Rare; used when none of the other DAW codes apply and further explanation is needed. |
