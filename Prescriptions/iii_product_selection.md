# 📘 Appendix III: Product Selection Codes

Brand-name drugs are patented and sold under proprietary names. Generic drugs contain the same active ingredients, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as their brand counterparts and must meet FDA standards for pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. In most cases, they are considered therapeutically equivalent.

Pharmacy technicians are generally expected to dispense generics unless the prescriber indicates otherwise using a **Dispense as Written (DAW)** code. Certain medications, such as hormones, narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants), or those with known pharmacogenomic variability, may require special handling.

## 🧾 DAW Reference Table

| **DAW Code** | **Meaning** | **When It’s Used** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **0** | No product selection indicated | Default; generic substitution is allowed and expected. |
| **1** | Substitution not allowed by prescriber | Prescriber wants **brand only** (e.g., writes “Brand Medically Necessary”). |
| **2** | Substitution allowed—patient requested brand | Patient insists on brand-name product. |
| **3** | Substitution allowed—pharmacist selected brand | Pharmacist chooses brand; rare, usually not reimbursed. |
| **4** | Substitution allowed—generic not in stock | Brand used temporarily due to inventory shortage. |
| **5** | Substitution allowed—brand dispensed as generic | Brand dispensed but billed as generic (often due to labeling agreements). |
| **6** | Override | Special approval to bypass normal substitution rules (e.g., plan override, emergency). |
| **7** | Substitution not allowed—brand mandated by law | Certain drugs must be dispensed as brand per state law (e.g., anticonvulsants in some states). |
| **8** | Substitution allowed—generic not available in marketplace | No generic exists. Brand required. |
| **9** | Other | Miscellaneous or special cases requiring further explanation. |
