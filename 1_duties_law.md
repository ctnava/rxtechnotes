# Chapter 1: Duties & Law for Pharmacy Technicians

Notes on general duties and laws to follow for pharmacy technicians.

## Personnel in the Pharmacy

### Pharmacy Clerk/ Assistant

Clerks are unlicensed personnel that focus on customer service and store operations. They typically only require a high school diploma & On-the-Job training. Their scope generally includes:

- **Customer Service**: Greet customers, answering phone calls, taking medication orders or prescriptions
- **Data Entry**: Entering patient information and insurance details into the pharmacy system
- **Inventory Management**: Stocking shelves, checking inventory levels, receiving shipments
- **Payment Processing**: Collecting payment from customers
- **Administrative Tasks**: Filing patient records, organizing paperwork

### Pharmacy Technicians

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the doctor's skill or expertise. These people require state licensure at a minimum and occasionally require national certification. A technician's general scope of practice generally includes:

- **Filling Prescriptions**: Receive and process prescriptions or medication orders, occasionally calculating and measuring out the correct amount of medication
- **Labeling Medications**: Packaging and labeling medications with instructions for patient use
- **Processing Insurance Claims**: Assist with billing and insurance claims as well as processing patient payments
- **Compounding Medications**: Prepare sterile and non-sterile medications, such as those used for cancer treatments or oral suspensions
- **Collecting Patient Information**: Enter patient information, including prescriptions into a computer system
- **Maintaining Inventory**: Track inventory stock levels, alerting the pharmacist to shortages

### Pharmacist

Pharmacists are the final authority on prescriptions and patient counseling. They are required to have a Doctorate of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree and state licensure through the NAPLEX & MPJE. They are responsible for:

- **Reviewing Filled Prescriptions & Labels**: to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, & clarity
- **Educating Patients**: on how to take prescription & Over-the-Counter medications, including dosage and explaining potential side effects
- **Checking for Drug Interactions**: between medications on a patient's profile and monitoring medication history to identify potential issues
- **Administering Certain Vaccinations**: depending on local regulations
- **Performing Basic Health Screenings**: like blood pressure checks in some situations

### Pharmacist Interns

Pharmacist Interns are pharmacists in training. They are required to be enrolled in a PharmD program and have an internship license. Under the supervision of a pharmacist, they:

- **Interact with Patients**: by taking detailed medication histories, verify patient information against prescriptions, and answer basic drug information questions from patients
- **Prepare Medications**: Count and package medications according to prescriptions, label containers accurately, mix certain drug preparations
- **Perform Administrative Tasks**: like entering prescription data on computers, check inventory levels, perform price checks on medications, and maintain pharmacy records

## Compliance with the Law

Technicians & other personnel are required to follow *state* & *federal* laws while working under the supervision of pharmacists. Technicians that fail to observe relevant law are punished alongside their supervising pharmacist.

### Regulatory Bodies

Laws in the USA are created and enforced on the state and federal level. ***Federal laws*** are enacted by *congress* if they pertain to federal matters; meaning they apply to the entirety of the United States. ***State Laws*** are are enacted by *legislatures* if they pertain to state; meaning that they only apply within the borders of that state. Generally speaking, if there are two conflicting laws, ***you must follow the stricter law***. Following both state and federal regulations is mandatory.

#### Federal Agencies

Two prominent *federal* agencies involved in the regulation of pharmacy are the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

- **The FDA** was established in 1938 by the ***Federal Food Drug & Cosmetics Act (FDCA)*** and is in charge of assuring the safety, efficacy, & quality of; drugs as well as medical devices; food, cosmetics, and supplements; and products that emit radiation.
- **The DEA** was established in 1973 as part of the ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA)*** of 1970 as its primary enforcement agency.

In addition to laws enforced by these agencies, there are federal laws regulating the treatment of patients that apply to various aspects of pharmacy. These laws guarantee certain rights for patients including: privacy & confidentiality; the right to file complaints; and the right to refuse treatment.

#### State Agencies

In each state, departments of professional regulation or state boards are responsible for licensing all prescribers and dispensers. There are also state boards of pharmacy that administer state regulations for the practice of pharmacy. In many states, non-physicians (e.g. nurse practitioners, dentists, vets, pharmacists, & physician assistants) have limited prescribing authority following protocol.

#### Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

There are various professional bodies and associations that set and maintain standards that get encoded into law.

- **American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)**: An accrediting organization for pharmacy residency & technician programs.
- **United States Pharmacopeia Convention (USP)**: A voluntary non-profit  that sets standards on manufacture & distribution of drugs & related products in the USA. These standards are adopted on the state and federal level in the *United States Pharmacopeia & National Formulary*.
- **The Joint Commission (TJC)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **The American Society for Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP)**: Sets standards for the practice of pharmacy who provide medication distribution and consultation for nursing homes.
- **The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC)**: Sets standards for pharmacies that provide services in the realm of: infusion, community retail, long-term care, & specialty pharmacy. They also administer the *Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB)* accreditation.

##### National Certification (Optional)

A ***Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT)*** is a technician who has earned certification from a recognized professional organization such as the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB)*** or the ***National Healthcareer Association (NHA)***. CPhTs are considered to have demonstrated a higher level of competency in pharmacy practice and may be eligible for additional responsibilities, such as inventory management, medication reconciliation support, or billing under a pharmacistâ€™s supervision.

Being a CPhT is a nationally recognized credential that can lead to increased job opportunities and higher income potential. CPhTs also gain professional credibility and may qualify for advancement opportunities.

Certification requires passing the  ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE)*** or ***Examination for Certified Pharmacy Technicians (ExCPT)***, go through a pharmacy technician training program, and have a certain amount of work experience as a licensed pharmacy technician. Recertification is on a 2-year cycle and requires 20 hours of ***Continuing Education (CE)*** credits, with at least one hour in **Pharmacy Law** and one in **Patient Safety**.

Certification requires passing either the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE)*** or the ***Examination for Certified Pharmacy Technicians (ExCPT)***, and meeting eligibility criteria such as completing a recognized training program or having equivalent work experience. Recertification is required every two years and includes 20 hours of ***Continuing Education (CE)***, with at least one hour in ***Pharmacy Law*** and one in ***Patient Safety***.

##### State Licensure (Required)

A licensed Pharmacy Technician (PhT) is a technician who has met the legal requirements set by the state in which they work. Licensure grants legal authority to perform pharmacy-related tasks under the supervision of a pharmacist. Most states require licensure or registration, and the process helps ensure compliance with state-specific laws and regulations.

**Requirements are state-specific**, but commonly include completing an accredited pharmacy technician training program, passing a national certification exam (such as the PTCE or ExCPT), undergoing background checks and drug screening, and submitting an application to the state's board of pharmacy.

In **California**, pharmacy technicians must complete 20 hours of **CE** every two years for license renewal, including at least **1 hour in cultural competency**. Renewal notices are mailed 90 days before license expiration. Licenses that are not renewed within 90 days after expiration are canceled.

California does **not** have a formal license reciprocity process. Technicians moving to another state must meet that state's licensing requirements. Returning to California may require reapplying with all original documentation if the license has been canceled.

## Important Legislation

### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA) of 1970

The OSHA was passed to ensure the safety of workers nationwide, including the pharmacy. Workers must be trained in safety measures and be provided Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when exposure to hazardous substances is possible. It also requires that Materials Safety Data Sheets (SDS) be made available to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

### The Health Information Privacy & Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996

HIPAA regulates how ***covered entities*** handle ***Protected Health Information (PHI)***. It is a large statute that primarily concerns the continuation of health insurance coverage for workers who leave their jobs. Under HIPAA, healthcare providers and other covered entities are required to use a ***National Provider Identifier (NPI)*** for all standard transactions covered by HIPAA. All personnel that have access to PHI must be formally trained periodically on HIPAA regulations to stay up to date and there must be a designated privacy officer appointed on duty.

- **Covered Entities**:
- **PHI**: Any and all individually identifiable health information. This includes the manner of transmission and the contents of patient counseling when it includes enough information to identify the patient.
- **NPI**: A ten-digit number, with a check digit in the last position to help detect keying errors. Each covered entity may receive only one unique NPI similar to a person's Social Security Number (SSN).

Patients must be informed of their privacy rights, how the pharmacy handles information, and have access to their PHI records if requested. This is usually done at pharmacies by presenting a ***Notification of Privacy Policies (NPP)*** and having the patient sign an "acknowledgement" form, which is stored for at least 6 years from the last date of service.

- **NPP**:

Under HIPAA, medical personnel cannot disclose any PHI to anyone other than the patient unless the patient has given express consent, including spouses & relatives. One such form of consent is a Release of Information form that is typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or to receive for their personal use.

#### Violations

Violations must be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights: within 60 days of the end of a calender year if the breach affects less than 500 people; or within 60 days if it affects more.
