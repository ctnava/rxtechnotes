# Chapter 1: Duties, Law, & Ethics for Pharmacy Technicians

Notes on general duties and laws to follow for pharmacy technicians.

---

## Pharmacy Personnel

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the pharmacist's skill or expertise.

### Pharmacy Clerk/ Assistant

Pharmacy clerks (also called assistants) are **unlicensed personnel** who support front-end operations and customer service. They typically need only a high school diploma and on-the-job training. Their duties include:

- **Customer Service**: Greeting customers, answering phones, accepting prescriptions
- **Data Entry**: Inputting patient and insurance information into the pharmacy system
- **Inventory Tasks**: Stocking shelves, checking stock levels, receiving shipments
- **Payment Processing**: Handling customer payments and receipts
- **Clerical Work**: Filing records, organizing paperwork

> 🛑 **Note**: In some states, clerks may not be permitted to enter or access prescription data.

### Pharmacy Technicians (PhT)

Pharmacy technicians are **healthcare professionals** who assist pharmacists with technical tasks. In some states, techs are only registered, not licensed. At minimum states require that technicians are **registered (and usually licensed)**, while some employers may also require **national certification**. Their scope of practice typically includes:

- **Prescription Processing**: Receiving and processing medication orders, measuring and preparing dosages
- **Labeling**: Packaging and labeling medications with usage instructions
- **Insurance Processing**: Assisting with insurance claims and patient billing
- **Compounding**: Preparing sterile and non-sterile medications under pharmacist supervision
- **Patient Records**: Collecting and entering patient data into pharmacy systems
- **Inventory Management**: Monitoring stock and notifying pharmacists of shortages

### Pharmacist Interns

Interns are pharmacy students enrolled in a PharmD program and working under a **pharmacist’s supervision**. They typically hold an **intern license**. Responsibilities include:

- **Patient Interaction**: Taking medication histories and verifying prescriptions
- **Medication Prep**: Counting, packaging, and labeling prescriptions
- **Administrative Support**: Entering data, monitoring inventory, and maintaining records

### Pharmacist

Pharmacists are healthcare professionals licensed to **dispense medications**, **counsel patients**, and **oversee pharmacy operations**. They must hold a **Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)** degree and pass the **NAPLEX and MPJE** for licensure. Their duties include:

- **Prescription Review**: Ensuring accuracy, safety, and clarity in filled prescriptions
- **Patient Education**: Explaining medication use, side effects, and safety
- **Drug Interaction Checks**: Monitoring for potential medication conflicts
- **Administering Vaccines**: Providing immunizations (as allowed by state law)
- **Health Screenings**: Conducting blood pressure checks and other basic screenings

#### Additional Requirements Set Forth by Law

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

##### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The ***Omnibus Budget Reconcillation Act (OBRA-90 or "the Omnibus", 1990)*** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
- ⛔ **Document Refusals of Counsel**: Rejections of counsel must be signed and stored as part of the patient's medication profile.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

##### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The ***Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)*** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide ***Medication Therapy Mangement (MTM)*** services. These include:

- Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs. This is done to ensure compliance to, both, reduce waste and improve therapy outcomes.

## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- If laws conflict, the **stricter law must be followed**.

### Regulatory Bodies

#### Federal Agencies

- **FDA (Food and Drug Administration)**: Established by the *Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)*. Oversees safety and regulation of drugs, devices, cosmetics, supplements, and radiation-emitting products.
- **DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration)**: Enforces the *Controlled Substances Act (1970)* and regulates controlled substances.

Other federal laws protect patient rights, including the right to refuse treatment, and to file complaints.

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

### ⚖️ Court of Law

Judicial law has two main divisions:

- **Criminal Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to society
- **Civil Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to an individual

In civil law, there are two major subdivisions:

- **Contracts**: legal agreements that have duties associated with them
- **Torts**: civil wrongs that have duties associated with them, created by law

Torts are a branch of civil law in which the courts determine remedies for alleged harm suffered by people who have no formal relationship with the offender and the majority of court cases involving pharmacists are torts. These are typically **negligence lawsuits**, where a person or legal party who failed to use reasonable caution when providing care or services which resulted in damages to the victim. **Malpractice** is a type of negligence lawsuit brough against a person with a professional license.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.

#### 💊 Medication Safety Practices & Errors

**Medication safety** is crucial to reducing errors and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. Pharmacy technicians play a key role in maintaining safety by ✅*adhering to proper procedures*, ⚠️*identifying potential risks*, and 👩‍⚕️*collaborating with pharmacists*.

**Medication errors** can occur at any stage of the medication-use process. Patient safety depends on accurate prescription processing and dispensing, for which the FDA, ISMP, and USP provide safety guidelines. Common medication errors include:

- ❌ **Prescribing Errors**: incorrect drug selection, dose, or instructions
- ✍️ **Transcription Errors**: data entry mistakes leading to incorrect labels
- 💊 **Dispensing Errors**: wrong medication, strength, or dosage form
- ⛔ **Administration Errors**: Incorrect patient instructions
- 👀 **Monitoring Errors**: Failure to detect interactions or reactions

##### 🔐 Error Prevention Strategies

- 🔄 Double-check all prescriptions before dispensing
- 🏷️ Use barcodes to verify medication
- 🗣️ Maintain clear communication with pharmacists and prescribers
- 📝 Report and document errors for quality improvement
- ✅ Follow the Five Rights when dispensing:
  - ✔️ Right Patient
  - ✔️ Right Drug
  - ✔️ Right Dose
  - ✔️ Right Route
  - ✔️ Right Timing

##### 🛡️ Best Practices for Safe Handling

- 🏠 Store medications properly to maintain potency and prevent contamination
- 🏷️ Label medications clearly and include expiration dates
- 📚 Educate patients on proper medication use and side effects
- 📂 Keep accurate records and update patient profiles
- 🎓 Engage in continuous training on safety procedures

## Important Legislation

Below are vital pieces of legislation to know as a pharmacy technician.

### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

Ensures workplace safety. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

> ⚠️ Chemotherapy agents and other hazardous drugs must have Safety Data Sheets!

### The Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) - 1996

HIPAA protects patient privacy by regulating how **Covered Entities** handle **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. It is a large statute that primarily concerns the continuation of health insurance coverage for workers who leave their jobs. UAll personnel that have access to PHI must be formally trained periodically on HIPAA regulations to stay up to date and there must be a designated privacy officer appointed on duty.

- **Covered Entities**: Individuals or organizations that are subject to HIPAA regulations because they handle protected health information (PHI) in connection with standard electronic transactions. Covered entities include:
  - **Health Plans**: Insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid
  - **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, and other licensed providers who transmit health data electronically
  - **Healthcare Clearinghouses**: Entities that process or facilitate the processing of nonstandard health information into a standard format

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information (oral, written, or electronic) that can be used to identify a patient and that relates to the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare. PHI is protected under HIPAA and must be kept confidential by all Covered Entities and Business Associates. Under HIPAA, this information must be safeguarded through administrative, physical, and technical controls, and can only be disclosed with patient authorization or for certain permitted purposes such as treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
  PHI includes but is not limited to:
  - **Spoken Word (Verbal)**: Conversations between healthcare providers or with patients
  - **Personal identifiers**: Name, address, birthdate, Social Security Number
  - **Medical records (Written)**: Notes, Diagnoses, treatment plans, lab results, prescriptions, faxes received
  - **Billing information**: Insurance details, account numbers, claims
  - **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** and any digital communication containing identifiable health information
  - **Other Electronic (ePHI)**: Emails, EHRs, text messages, or files stored on computers or mobile devices

- **NPI (National Provider Identifier)**: 10-digit number assigned to healthcare providers for standardized identification. Each covered entity may receive only one unique NPI, similar to a person's Social Security Number (SSN), and must be used for all standard transactions covered by HIPAA.
- **NPP (Notice of Privacy Practices)**: Outlines how patient info is used and protected; patients must sign acknowledgment, retained for 6 years from the date of creation or last date in effect (whichever is later) and usually means from the last date of service.

#### Restrictions, Violations, & Penalties

Under HIPAA, medical personnel cannot disclose any PHI to anyone other than the patient unless the patient has given express consent, including spouses & relatives. One such form of consent is a Release of Information form that is typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or to receive for their personal use. This includes accessing your own records without following proper protocol.

HIPAA violations (e.g., improper disclosure of PHI) must be reported to the **Office for Civil Rights** at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services:

- Within **60 days** of discovery if the breach affects **500 or more** people
- Annually (within 60 days of year-end) for smaller breaches

Patients have the right to obtain a copy of their healthcare records. If a patient asks for their records, you have 30 days to comply.

Offenses carried out with the intent to sell, transfer, or use the information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm can result in fines up to $250,000, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.

Violations due to reasonable cause and not willfull neglect can result in $1,000 to $50,000 fines.

> **NOTE** HIPAA allows the sharing of PHI under emergency situations such as natural disasters where people may be evacuated and require healthcare. Notice of disclosures still need to be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable after the emergency.

#### The Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act (HITECH, 2009)

- mends HIPAA to promote adoption and meaningful use of health information technology, including electronic prescribing & medical records
- set standards for the creation of these electronic systems
- expanded Covered Entities to include business associates
