## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

### Regulatory Bodies

#### Federal vs. State Law

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- If laws conflict, the **stricter law must be followed**.

#### Federal Agencies

- **FDA (Food and Drug Administration)**: Established by the *Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)*. Oversees safety and regulation of drugs, devices, cosmetics, supplements, and radiation-emitting products.
- **DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration)**: Enforces the *Controlled Substances Act (1970)* and regulates controlled substances.

Other federal laws protect patient rights, including the right to refuse treatment, and to file complaints.

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

#### Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

While not government entities, these organizations shape pharmacy standards:

- **ASHP (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)**: Accredits pharmacy residencies and technician training programs
- **USP (United States Pharmacopeia Convention)**: Develops official drug quality standards adopted nationwide via the *USP–NF*
- **TJC (The Joint Commission)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **ASCP (American Society for Consultant Pharmacists)**: Sets standards for the practice of pharmacy who provide medication distribution and consultation for nursing homes.
- **ACHC (Accreditation Commission for Health Care)**: Sets standards for pharmacies that provide services in the realm of: infusion, community retail, long-term care, & specialty pharmacy. They also administer the *Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB)* accreditation.

##### National Certification (Optional)

A **Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT)** is credentialed by organizations such as the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB)*** or ***National Healthcareer Association (NHA)***. Certification demonstrates advanced competency and may qualify technicians for expanded duties, such as medication reconciliation or billing.

- **Benefits**: National recognition, greater job opportunities, higher wages, enhanced credibility
- **Exams**: Must pass either the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE)*** (by the PTCB) or ***Examination for Certified Pharmacy Technicians (ExCPT)*** (by the NHA)
- **Recertification**: Every 2 years, requiring 20 hours of ASHP-accredited **Continuing Education (CE)**, including:
  - 1 hour in **Pharmacy Law**
  - 1 hour in **Patient Safety**

##### State Licensure (Required)

Pharmacy Technicians must be licensed and registered in most states. Licensure allows them to perform pharmacy tasks under pharmacist supervision and ensures adherence to local laws. **Requirements are state-specific**, but commonly include:

- Completion of a state-approved training program
- Passing a national exam (PTCE or ExCPT)
- Background checks and drug screening
- Application through the **State Board of Pharmacy**

In California:

- **CE Requirements**: 20 hours every 2 years, including **1 hour in cultural competency**
- **Renewals**: Notices mailed 90 days before expiration; licenses are canceled if not renewed within 90 days post-expiration
- **License Portability**: California has **no reciprocity**; technicians moving to other states must reapply there. Returning to CA may require full reapplication if the license was canceled

## Important Legislation

### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA) - 1970

Ensures workplace safety. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

### The Health Information Privacy & Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996

HIPAA protects patient privacy by regulating how **Covered Entities** handle **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. It is a large statute that primarily concerns the continuation of health insurance coverage for workers who leave their jobs. UAll personnel that have access to PHI must be formally trained periodically on HIPAA regulations to stay up to date and there must be a designated privacy officer appointed on duty.

- **Covered Entities**: Individuals or organizations that are subject to HIPAA regulations because they handle protected health information (PHI) in connection with standard electronic transactions. Covered entities include:
  - **Health Plans**: Insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid
  - **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, and other licensed providers who transmit health data electronically
  - **Healthcare Clearinghouses**: Entities that process or facilitate the processing of nonstandard health information into a standard format

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information—oral, written, or electronic—that can be used to identify a patient and that relates to the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare. PHI is protected under HIPAA and must be kept confidential by all Covered Entities and Business Associates.
  PHI includes but is not limited to:
  - **Personal identifiers**: Name, address, birthdate, Social Security Number
  - **Medical records**: Diagnoses, treatment plans, lab results, prescriptions
  - **Billing information**: Insurance details, account numbers, claims
  - **Electronic health records (EHRs)** and any digital communication containing identifiable health information

  PHI can exist in **three forms**:

  - **Spoken**: Conversations between healthcare providers or with patients
  - **Written**: Paper documents, faxes, or notes
  - **Electronic (ePHI)**: Emails, digital records, text messages, or files stored on computers or mobile devices

  Under HIPAA, this information must be safeguarded through administrative, physical, and technical controls, and can only be disclosed with patient authorization or for certain permitted purposes such as treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.

- **NPI (National Provider Identifier)**: 10-digit number assigned to healthcare providers for standardized identification. Each covered entity may receive only one unique NPI similar to a person's Social Security Number (SSN). It must be used for all standard transactions covered by HIPAA.
- **NPP (Notice of Privacy Practices)**: Outlines how patient info is used and protected; patients must sign acknowledgment, retained for 6 years from the last date of service.

Under HIPAA, medical personnel cannot disclose any PHI to anyone other than the patient unless the patient has given express consent, including spouses & relatives. One such form of consent is a Release of Information form that is typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or to receive for their personal use.

HIPAA violations (e.g., improper disclosure of PHI) must be reported to the **Office for Civil Rights** at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services:

- Within **60 days** of discovery if the breach affects **500 or more** people
- Annually (within 60 days of year-end) for smaller breaches
