# Chapter 2: The Discovery, Manufacture, & Logistics of Drugs

This chapter covers how drugs are discovered, developed, tested, manufactured, distributed, and monitored for safety.

## Historical Background

### The Pure Food, Drugs, & Cosmetics Act (FDC, 1906)

- Prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated or misbranded food and drugs
- Required government preapproval of drugs before marketing or sale
- Enforced by the Bureau of Chemistry (precursor to the FDA) until the Food, Drug, & Insecticide Administration was formed in 1927 and rebranded as the FDA in 1930.

### The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA, 1938)

- Required that new drugs must be proven **safe** before marketing.
- Passed after the **sulfanilamide** tragedy, which caused over 100 deaths (many of which were children) after using this drug in an oral tablet dosage form

> **Note**: Thalidomide is now FDA-approved for treating multiple myeloma and leprosy. Use requires strict risk acknowledgment from both men and women.

### Kefauver-Harris Amendment (1962)

- Required that new drugs must also be proven **effective**
- Passed after the **thalidomide** tragedy, which caused severe birth defects in pregnant women when it was used as a sleeping pill without any warnings
- Reinforced by Alberty Food Products v. US (1950), which required labeling intended use.

> 🤯 In 1976, the Medical Device Regulation Act (or "Medical Device Amendments") established the framework for regulating medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness. This means pre-market approval is required for life-sustaining and life-supporting medical devices (Class III).

## Drug Development & Manufacturing

There exist two commercial categories of drugs:

- **Brand Name Drugs**: Original drugs developed by pharmaceutical companies, protected by patents, and marketed under proprietary names
- **Generic Drugs**: Copies of brand-name drugs that have the same active ingredients, strength, dosage form, and route of administration, but sold under generic chemical names or different brand names after the original patent expires

> **TRIVIA**: The Orphan Drug Act (1983) provides incentives to promote research, approval, and marketing of drugs needed for the treatment of rare (therefore less profitable) diseases.

### Brand Name Drug Development

In order for a newly patented, *Brand Name* drug to come to market, the FDA must first approve it. The process generally is as follows:

#### Step 1: Research & Development (3-6 Years)

- Identify a biological target
- Screen compounds for activity and specificity
- Select ~25% of promising candidates for preclinical testing

#### Step 2: Preclinical Testing (1 Year)

- Conduct **in vitro** (human cells) tests for efficacy & toxicity
- Conduct **in vivo** (animal) tests to study ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) processes
- Test in at least two mammalian species.
- Submit results and a clinical plan to the FDA's CDER in an ***Investigational New Drug (IND)*** application. This application additionally requires a plan for human testing and manufacturing details to comply with the ***Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)*** provisioned by the Kefauver-Harris Amendment.

#### Step 3: Clinical Trials (4-7 Years)

Clinical trials involve human research subjects and are conducted in three phases. Participants must give informed consent and the information necessary to provide it (per Kefauver-Harris Amendment). They are free to leave as they wish.

- **Phase 1 (20 - 80 People)**: Determine ***safety*** first by collecting a profile of side effects in a small group of healthy volunteers over ***several months***.
- **Phase 2 (100-300 People)**: Determine ***efficacy*** by testing it on a group of patients with the condition that the drug is trying to treat while also staying on the look out for side effects for ***several months to 2 years***. Controlled trials are also used to compare the drug's activity against a placebo. This test is double-blind, meaning that neither the patients nor the prescribers are aware that the drug is a placebo.
- **Phase 3 (1,000 - 3,000 People)**: Confirm ***efficacy*** while collecting ***additional safety*** data in a larger population. Also gathering data on interactions and effects at different ***dosages*** for ***1 to 4 years***.

> **NOTE**: Pediatric clinical trials can take place after Phase 2 or 3 Adult trials if the company is trying to get the drug approved for use in children.

#### Step 4: Review & Approval (1-2 Years)

- Pharmaceutical company files a ***New Drug Application (NDA)*** with the FDA
- FDA reviews for safety, efficacy, and labeling
- Drug is either approved for marketing (regulated by the Kefauver-Harris Amendment) or denied by the FDA and request further testing

#### Step 5: Post-Market Surveillance (Ongoing)

- Manufacturer maintains exclusive rights (~20 years) to offset research & development cost
- Continuous monitoring of long-term safety and efficacy after the drug is released to the market

##### Risk Evaluation & Mitigation Strategies (REMS)

In some cases, the FDA may require additional safety measures for high-risk medications after they are brought to market. Established under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, REMS are required safety programs for medications with known or potential serious risks that must be managed to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks.

Depending on the drug, a REMS program may include one or more of the following:

- ***Medication guides*** or ***patient package inserts (PPIs)***
- Prescriber training and certification requirements
- Pharmacy certification and restricted dispensing systems
- Enrollment of patients in registries or special monitoring programs

> **Example**: The drug isotretinoin (Accutane), which can cause severe birth defects, is subject to a REMS program called iPLEDGE that requires prescribers, pharmacies, and patients to follow strict steps before dispensing or receiving the medication.

###### 📦 Patient Package Inserts (PPIs)

PPIs (also "Patient Labeling") are required for oral contraceptives, estrogen containing products, and metered dose inhalers. These are required to be dispensed with each prescription. Patient labeling that can be part of the FDA-approved prescription drug labeling that includes information on:

| Section | What It Covers |
|---------|----------------|
| **Clinical Pharmacology** | How the drug works in the body, including: Mechanism of action, Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), Demographic considerations (e.g., effects in children, pregnancy) |
| **Indications & Usage** | Lists the **FDA-approved uses** of the drug (*Note:* Drugs are sometimes used “off-label” for other conditions, based on provider discretion.) |
| **Contraindications** | Situations where the drug **should not be used**, such as certain medical conditions, allergies, or interactions. |
| **Warnings** | Serious or life-threatening risks associated with the drug (e.g., Black Box Warnings). |
| **Precautions** | Instructions to help avoid harm, including guidance that informs **auxiliary labels**. |
| **Adverse Reactions** | Lists all known **side effects**, including those reported during clinical trials or post-marketing. |
| **Drug Abuse & Dependence** | Details on the drug’s potential for **abuse, tolerance, or dependence** (especially important for controlled substances). |
| **Overdosage** | Emergency protocol and symptoms of overdose. |
| **Dosage & Administration** | How to take the medication, including dose, timing, route, and adjustments. |
| **How Supplied / Storage**  | Describes the drug’s appearance (shape, color, imprint) and **storage conditions** (e.g., keep refrigerated, protect from light). |

Always verify that a PPI is included with the medication if required. If it's missing from stock bottles or software, ask the pharmacist to print it from the FDA or drug manufacturer’s website.

> 📌 Failure to provide a required PPI can be a violation of federal law.

### Generic Drug Manufacturing

Once a patent for a brand name drug expires, other manufacturers may copy the drug and release it under its generic name. Generic drugs require FDA approval but do not require full R&D because clinical trials for safety & efficacy were already established by the original producer. To obtain approval, generic manufacturers only need to demonstrate equivalency; shortening the process to 1 - 3 years.

#### Step 1: Bioequivalence Studies

During this process, the manufacturer must prove that their drug is both pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent because their inactive ingredients have been altered.

- **Pharmaceutically Equivalent Drugs** contain identical amounts of the same active ingredients in the same dosage form.
- **Therapeutically Equivalent Drugs** produce the same clinical effect.

Studies are conducted on a small group of healthy volunteers to compare the generic and brand-name drug's effects on ADME processes. After which, the manufacturer submits an **Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)** to the FDA.

#### Step 2: Manufacturing & Quality Assurance

The FDA checks for trademark violations. Packaging and labeling must be distinct from brand name. Inactive ingredients may vary to lower production cost, but a facility inspection is also conducted to ensure compliance with the aforementioned ***Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)***.

#### Step 3: Post-Market Surveillance

If the ANDA meets FDA requirements, the generic drug is approved for marketing. Generic drugs are also subject to the same post-market safety monitoring as brand name drugs.

---

> The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Hatch-Waxman, 1984) allows for both the extension of drug patent terms and quicker introduction of lower-cost generic drugs.

## Logistics

When a new drug is brought to market, its distribution is handled by suppliers and wholesalers.

- **Suppliers**: produce, label, and package drugs
- **Wholesalers**: purchase drugs in bulk and then sell them to medical facilities

### Suppliers

There are 3 main types of supplier: drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, and compounding pharmacies. All of them order raw materials or finished goods (like (in)active ingredients) to produce their goods. However, each one exists for a different scale of care.

- **Drug Manufacturers** package medication in standard dosage forms for mass distribution
- **Specialty Pharmacies** focus on providing high-cost, complex medications and specialized services to patients with chronic conditions
- **Compounding Pharmacies** customize medications on a patient-specific basic, often mixing, combinging, or altering existing drugs to meet individual needs

> **Note**: The federal **340B Drug Pricing Program** limits the cost safety-net providers, like medicaid, federally qualified health centers, and qualified hospitals paid for outpatient drugs through wholesalers.

### Wholesalers

Wholesalers purchase drugs from manufactures in bulk and create wide distribution networks to ensure availability by storing their purchases in warehouses around the country so that deliveries can be made in 24-48 hours. They also drop ship lower-volume, high-cost medications on an as-needed basis.

The **Prescription Drug Marketing Act** mandates that wholesalers & manufacturers:

- must be licensed by the states they operate in
- may not reimport batches of drugs once exported
- may only give samples of medication to doctors

### Drug Manufacturer Labels

Labels provide critical information about the medication name, dosage, instructions, safety warnings, batch number, manufacture & expiration dates.To simplify inventory tracking, barcodes and National Drug Codes are used. The ISMP encourages the use of **tall man lettering** to prevent look-alike or sound-alike drugs from being confused with one another.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️The **Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 1970)** mandates that manufacturers clearly label controlled drugs with their classification or schedule. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

#### Fair Packaging & Labeling Act (FPLA, 1967)

The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) requires all consumer products (including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and many prescription drug packages) to bear labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand. Enforced by the FDA (for food, drugs, cosmetics) and the FTC (for other consumer goods), this act ensures transparency and prevents deceptive packaging.

Under the FPLA, drug packaging must include:

- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- An accurate statement of the quantity of the contents (by weight, measure, or count)
- A clear declaration of the product’s identity and intended use

These requirements complement the FDA’s misbranding and labeling rules under the FDCA and ensure consumers receive consistent and honest information, regardless of brand.

> 📌 The FPLA helps prevent misbranding by requiring clarity and standardization in labeling. Technicians must ensure that OTC products and bulk containers are correctly labeled before stocking shelves or filling orders.

#### National Drug Code (NDC)

The **Drug Listing Act** of 1972 mandates that all drug establishments provide a complete list of drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for distribution, and these drugs must have a ***11-digit National Drug Code (NDC)***; a 3-segmented universal identifier. It's NATO-specific counterpart is called the NATO Stock Number (NSN).

Sample NDC: `12345-6789-01`

| Digits            | Name                      | Description                                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 12345             | Labeler Code (5 Digits)   | Identifies the manufacturer or distributor. Assigned by the FDA. |
| 6789              | Product Code (4 Digits)   | Identifies a specific strength, dosage form, and formulation.    |
| 01                | Package Code (2 Digits)   | Identifies package size and type.                                |

> **Note**: The NDC can appear in different segment configurations (5-4-2, 4-4-2, or 5-3-2), depending on how the manufacturer registered the drug with the FDA. When stored in databases, it is often reformatted as an 11-digit number (with leading zeroes added if needed).

#### Barcodes

Barcodes are quickly scanned for inventory tracking and come in two varieties: linear and matrix.

- **Linear Barcodes (1D)** appear as stripes that can be read forward or backwards and encodes NDC. Used for stock checks.
- **Matrix Barcodes (2D)** appear as squares with black or white pixels; encoding NDC, batch, and expiration. Used in prescription filling to verify the correct product is being used.

## Quality Assurance

The FDA is responsible for enforcing rules against adultering and misbranding.

- **Adulteration**: Contanimation or failure to meet purity & quality standards
- **Misbranding**: Including false, inaccurate, improper, or confusing labeling or if the product is harmful when used according to label directions

> The Drug Quality & Security Act (2013) expands the authority of the FDA to include compounded drugs.

### Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)

GMP are a set of quality assurance standards enforced by the FDA to ensure that drugs are consistently produced and controlled according to rigorous safety and quality criteria. These standards apply to both brand name and generic manufacturers and were strengthened under the Kefauver-Harris Amendment of 1962.

GMP requirements help prevent adulteration and misbranding by mandating that manufacturers:

- Use validated and standardized manufacturing processes
- Maintain clean, hygienic, and climate-controlled facilities
- Employ qualified staff with documented training
- Keep detailed records of production and quality control
- Perform regular audits and allow FDA inspections

Facilities that fail to meet GMP standards may face fines, recalls, or loss of manufacturing licenses. Compliance with GMP ensures that every batch of medication meets the same identity, strength, quality, and purity requirements as approved by the FDA.

> 📌 Pharmacy technicians may encounter GMP-related topics during FDA recalls, quality investigations, or compounding procedures.

### FDA-Initiated Recalls

While drug approval processes are thorough, it is impossible to account for everything. The FDA maintains reporting programs called **MedWatch** and the **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)** that allow anyone to report adverse effects that occur from the use of approved drugs or vaccines. If the FDA determines that any drug or vaccine poses a public health risk, then they may file an injunction to prevent distribution; seize the drug from the manufacturer; or issue a recall of the drug.

> Recalls are the most cost-effective because they leverage the manufacturer's current infrastructure and knowledge to retrieve offending drugs. Shipping manifests are used to identify where a drug has been delivered in order to focus efforts on that area.

There are 3 numerical classes of recalls.

| Class                 | Description|
|-----------------------|------------|
|1 (Highest Urgency)    | Likely to cause serious harm or death |
|2 (Moderate Urgency)   | May cause reversible harm; serious effects are unlikely |
|3 (Lowest Urgency)     | Not likely to cause harm; violates labeling or manufacturing standards |

Recalls are generally handled in 4 steps.

1. **Reports of Adverse Effects** The FDA receives enough reports of adverse effects or misbranding (through MedWatch or VAERS) that it decides the product is a threat and contacts the manufacturer to recall.
2. **Manufacturer Notice** The manufacturer establishes a plan to recall that addresses severity, warns the public, and a means for checking the effectiveness of the recall.
3. **Public Notice** The manufacturer contacts customers (e.g. wholesalers, pharmacies, & more) to notify them that a product of a certain name, size, lot number, serial number, or any other identifiers are being recalled. This notice includes the nature of the recall and the amount of danger involved so that they may protect their clients. They are also supplied with instructions on what to do with affected products, beginning with the cessation of distribution.
4. **Public Listing** These recalls are listed in the weekly FDA enforcement report.

> **Note** The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) governs the generation, management, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes. This includes medication and other drugs.

### Other Recalls

- **Manufacturer Recalls**: are initiated when they detect a defect, contamination, or labeling error. When this happens, they are legally required to notify the FDA and take appropriate action.
- **Pharmacy Chain & Distributor Recalls**: Large pharmacy chains and wholesalers may voluntarily recall products from their shelves to to internal quality checks or concerns raised by pharmacists. They may also respond to manufacturer or FDA recalls by removing affected products from circulation. This can happen in the event that it's discovered that medication was held in improper storage conditions that could compromise effectiveness.

### The Role of a Technician

Technicians must stay up to date with recalls posted online. When a recall is brought to their attention, they must alert the pharmacist and store management; providing information for patient outreach. Recalls are generally handled in the pharmacy with the following methodology:

| Step      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Verify    | Verify the recall details (lot number, expiration date, affected batches) to see if affected lot numbers are present on shelves.  |
| Remove    | Remove affected products from inventory and quarantine them. |
| Notify    | Notify affected patients and healthcare providers (with online alerts, telephone calls, and physical notices) to instruct them to discontinue use. Additionally, arrange for refunds & exchanges. |
| Follow    | Follow manufacturer or FDA instructions for return or disposal of products. Stay alert for further guidance. |
| Document  | Document actions taken for pharmacy records to report compliances to regulatory authorities as required. |

## 📦 Pharmacy Inventory Systems & Control

Pharmacy inventory includes all medications and supplies used during normal operations. Efficient inventory management ensures medication availability, minimizes waste, and controls costs.

**Turnover Rate**: Number of days it takes to **sell or use the entire stock** of a particular item.

- A **high turnover rate** suggests good inventory control.
- A **low turnover rate** may indicate overstocking or slow-moving items.

> Pharmacies may also stock durable & nondurable medical equipment to dispense with prescriptions.

### 🧮 Inventory Management Systems

- **Perpetual Inventory System**
  - Maintains a **real-time record** of inventory.
  - Updates whenever medications are received or dispensed.
  - Required for **controlled substances (Schedules II–V)**.
  - Generates reorders based on **minimum/maximum stock levels**.

- **Point of Sale (POS) System**
  - Deducts items from inventory **at the time of sale or dispensing**.
  - Helps in real-time tracking of stock levels.

- **Automated Dispensing Systems (ADS)**
  - Use **computerized cabinets or robotics** to manage inventory in institutional settings.
  - Improves accuracy, reduces diversion, and speeds up the dispensing process.

#### 📊 Inventory Counts

- **Initial Inventory**: Performed before a pharmacy opens or begins handling controlled substances.
- **Biennial Inventory**: Required by federal law every 2 years to account for all controlled substances on hand.
- **Perpetual Inventory**: Continuous tracking, required for all **Schedule II** drugs.
- **Cycle Counts**: Periodic checks of small inventory segments to catch discrepancies early.

### 📦 Receiving, Handling, & Storage

When receiving an order, accuracy is essential. Technicians must:

- reconcile the shipment with the purchase order
- check the strength and amount of each item
- match shipment prices to the invoice
- return broken or damaged stock
- notify the supplier if there is a discrepancy

> ⚠️ C2 Medications are shipped separately from other drugs.

#### Stocking the Shelves

Best Practices:

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Older stock is used **before** newer stock to minimize expired medications. When stocking shelves, oldest stock should appear in the front.
- **LASA Medications (Look-Alike, Sound-Alike)**: Should be **separated**, flagged, or labeled with **Tall Man lettering** to reduce medication errors.
- **Mylars**: Special labels are used to alert pharmacy staff to hazardous drugs.

Special Storage Locations:

- **Fast Mover Shelf**: 20% of the inventory accounts for 80% of the orders. These medications (often designated the **"fast movers"**) typically have their own designated shelf. It is best practice to check if medications can be stocked there first.
- **Unit of Use Shelf**: medications dispensed in unit dose packaging (i.e. packages containing a single dose of medication) or medication packs (i.e. packages containing a whole course of medication) often have their own storage area.
- **ALPHA Shelves**: 80% of the inventory does not move very quickly and gets stored on alphabetized shelves.
- **Negative Pressure Isolation rooms** are used to store radioactive materials and other hazardous substances.

> Check **Fast Mover** and **Unit of Use** shelves first before placing medication on the **ALPHA** shelves.

#### 🌡️ USP Storage Temperature Guidelines

| Storage Type           | Temperature Range                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Freezer** | –25°C to –10°C (–13°F to 14°F) |
| **Refrigerated** | 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) |
| **Controlled Room Temp** | 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) |
| **Excessive Heat** | > 40°C (> 104°F) |

> *Temperatures should be monitored daily and recorded. Out-of-range readings must be reported immediately.*

#### 🏥 Floor Stock (Hospitals)

- Medications stored on nursing units for quick access.
- Must be tracked and restocked regularly.
- Common for over-the-counter or PRN medications.

### 🗑️ Expired Medications

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for routinely checking for expired, expiring, or discontinued medications. These drugs must be separated from active stock to avoid accidental dispensing.

- **Within 6 months of expiration**: Mark with a **"short-date" label**.
- **Within 3 months of expiration**: **Pull** from the shelf and quarantine from saleable stock.
- **Expired medications**: Must be stored in a **designated area** (often marked “Do Not Dispense”) until processed for return or disposal.

> Controlled substances must be logged and stored in compliance with DEA regulations.

### 🔄 Reverse Distribution & Drug Returns

**Reverse distributors** handle the safe return and destruction of expired, damaged, or discontinued medications.

Technicians must:

- Separate **non-returnable** from **returnable** items.
- Complete documentation and inventory logs.
- Package medications securely for transfer.
- **Controlled substances** require:
  - DEA Form 41 for destruction
  - DEA Form 222 for transfer of Schedule II medications

> Always follow facility SOPs and maintain chain-of-custody documentation.

#### ⚠️ Drug Recalls

- **Class I**: Serious health hazard or death (e.g., wrong drug in bottle).
- **Class II**: Temporary or reversible health effects.
- **Class III**: Unlikely to cause harm but violates FDA standards.

> Technicians assist with pulling recalled stock, notifying patients if required, and documenting the process.
