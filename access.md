# Access to Drugs

## Legal Designations

- **The Durham-Humphrey Amendment** (ðŸ”— [Link](./law/fda_fdca.md#durham-humphrey-amendment-1951))
- **Controlled & Listed Substance Policy** (ðŸ”— [Link](./law/csa_cmea.md))

- **Legend Drugs**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription" or "RX Only".
  - **Controlled/ Scheduled Medications** are regulated by the DEA due to abuse potential and risk to overall safety.
- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use.
  - **Exempt Narcotics** are medications that contain habit forming ingredients that can be sold by a pharmacist without prescriptions to persons 18 years or older (e.g. cough syrups with small amounts of codeine)
  - **Emergency Contraceptives** (e.g. Plan B One-Step) sometimes have dual marketing, with unique status as OTC & legend drugs at the same time. Depending on the state, a pharmacist may prescribe these on the spot to dispense to patients.
  - **Listed Substances** are monitored drugs, equipment, and chemicals with ***strict, time based controls*** on sale due to their use in the **illicit manufacture of methamphetamine**; commonly found in cold and allergy medications.

## Orders & Prescriptions

Instructions from a medical practictioner, that authorizes the issue of a drug or device to a patient, can come in one of two forms:

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
