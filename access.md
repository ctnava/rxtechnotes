# Access to Drugs

## Legal Designations

Federal and state law divide drugs into major categories based on how they may be distributed, their potential for abuse, and required labeling.

- 🔗 [The Durham-Humphrey Amendment](./law/fda_fdca.md#durham-humphrey-amendment-1951)
- 🔗 [Controlled & Listed Substance Policy](./law/csa_cmea.md)

### 💊 Legend Drugs

Prescription-only medications authorized under the **Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951)**. These drugs:

- Must be dispensed **only** on the **written, electronic, or verbal order** of a licensed prescriber.
- Require the **federal legend** on the manufacturer’s label:
  > "Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without a prescription"  
  or  
  > "Rx Only"
- Include:
  - **Non-controlled prescription medications** (e.g. antibiotics, blood pressure drugs)
  - **Controlled substances** (see below)

#### 🔐 Controlled Substances

- **Regulated by the DEA** under the **Controlled Substances Act (1970)**.
- Categorized into **Schedules I-V** based on **abuse potential**, **medical use**, and **dependence risk**.
- Subject to strict handling, labeling, inventory, and security requirements.
- Dispensing often involves:
  - 🐻 **CURES reporting** in California  
  - 🦅 **ID verification** and limited refill authorizations  

### 💸 Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs

Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are:

- Properly labeled for **self-directed use**
- Contain **adequate directions and warnings** for consumers
- Considered **safe and effective** when used as directed

Examples: `Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, loratadine`

**Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are not inherently safe** just because they don’t require a prescription. Many OTC medications can cause significant drug interactions, adverse effects, or even life-threatening complications; especially when combined with prescription drugs or taken incorrectly.

When performing **medication reconciliation** (the process of gathering a patient’s full medication history), pharmacy technicians must:

- **Ask about all OTC medications**, supplements, and herbal products
- **Document** them in the patient’s profile
- **Refer patients to the pharmacist** for counseling if any concerns arise

## Orders & Prescriptions

Instructions from a medical practictioner, that authorizes the issue of a drug or device to a patient, can come in one of two forms:

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.

### Intake & Entry

When a patient shows up to the pharmacy for the first time, they usually bring a prescription with them. In these instances, the technician must follow appropriate procedures for **New Patient Intake** before proceeding to **Prescription Intake & Order Entry**.

- 🔗 [Prescription Intake & Order Entry](./sop/prescription_intake.md)

### 🔄 Refills & Renewal Requests

Each prescription is assigned a **prescription number**, which stays the same for all refills. The number of authorized refills is written by the prescriber and usually printed on the **prescription label**. If a doctor authorizes multiple refills (often written as ‘Refills: 3’ or ‘Refills: PRN’), they are valid for **up to 1 year** from the date the prescription was written, **except for controlled substances**, which have stricter limits.

Refills can be requested:

- 📱 Via smartphone apps  
- 💻 Through pharmacy websites  
- 🤝 In person  
- ☎️ Over the phone

When a prescription has no refills or is expired, the technician is requesting a new prescription, not a ‘refill’ in the legal sense. **Pharmacy technicians** may be authorized to contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription.

### Prescription Transfers

Prescriptions may be transferred to another pharmacy at the request of a patient. State laws vary when it comes to different classes of drugs. Technicians may pull up the relevant records for transfer, however the pharmacist is responsible for the actual act of sending or receiving prescriptions.

## Filling Prescriptions

<!-- todo -->

### 🧩 Partial Fills

A **partial fill** occurs when the pharmacy dispenses **less than the full prescribed quantity** of a medication. This is typically due to **insufficient inventory**. The remainder is dispensed later once stock is available or as permitted by law.

## 🔔 Prescription Pickup & Handoff

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for verifying patient identity, ensuring regulatory compliance, offering pharmacist counseling, and documenting pickup to ensure accurate, legal, & professional handling of prescription pickups at the point of sale.
