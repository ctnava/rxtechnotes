# Ethics & Legal Compliance

## Ethics

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that helps decide what should be done in a principled sense besides what must be done to comply with laws. In the medical industry, universities, colleges, hospitals, and other organizations form Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) (or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)) to provide ethical guidance and ensure legal & ethical standards are followed. ERBs in hospitals can provide consultation for difficult ethical cases when they arise. Corporate compliance officers are responsible to investigate legal or ethical concerns identified in a business.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provide the following guidelines for compliance with federal and state law:

- the maintenance of written policies and procedures
- designation of a compliance officer and committee
- conducting effective training and education
- developing effective lines of communication
- auditing and monitoring
- enforcement through publicized disciplinary guidelines and policies dealing with ineligible persons
- responding to detected offenses, developing corrective action initiatives, and reporting to government authorities

Some basic values in ethical considerations include:

- **Autonomy** of the patient to choose their treatment
  - 🦅 *Federal law protects the patient's right to refuse treatment*
- **Beneficence** when treating patients
- **Dignification** of the patient
- **Non-Maleficence** when providing care
- **Justice** in healthcare
- **Honesty** in patient communication

## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- If laws conflict, the **stricter law must be followed**.

> 🦅 Federal law protects the patient's right to file complaints.

### Regulatory Bodies

#### Federal Agencies

- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: Established by the *Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)*. Oversees safety and regulation of drugs, devices, cosmetics, supplements, and radiation-emitting products.
- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: Enforces the *Controlled Substances Act (1970)* and regulates controlled substances.
- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**: The primary federal agency responsible for protecting the health of all Americans. Oversees public health programs and agencies including the CDC, FDA, CMS, and NIH. During public health emergencies, HHS can expand access to care through guidance and waivers (e.g., authorizing technicians to administer vaccines).

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

- **The Joint Commission (TJC)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)**: A nonprofit organization devoted to preventing medication errors. ISMP develops safety alerts, best practices, and error-prevention strategies widely adopted in pharmacy and healthcare settings.

### ⚖️ Court of Law

Judicial law has two main divisions:

- **Criminal Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to society
- **Civil Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to an individual

In civil law, there are two major subdivisions:

- **Contracts**: legal agreements that have duties associated with them
- **Torts**: civil wrongs that have duties associated with them, created by law

Torts are a branch of civil law in which the courts determine remedies for alleged harm suffered by people who have no formal relationship with the offender and the majority of court cases involving pharmacists are torts. These are typically **negligence lawsuits**, where a person or legal party who failed to use reasonable caution when providing care or services which resulted in damages to the victim. **Malpractice** is a type of negligence lawsuit brough against a person with a professional license.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.

### Important Legislation

Below are vital pieces of legislation to know as a pharmacy technician.

## Healthcare Coverage

### Social Security Act Amendments (1965)

These amendments to the Social Security Act created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C where it may act as an HMO or PPO offered by private insurers.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

> 🤯 The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010) was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.
