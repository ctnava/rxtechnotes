# Ethics & Legal Compliance

*Technicians* are individuals who are given a basic level of training designed to help them with important specific tasks. Pharmacists rely on *pharmacy technicians* as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the pharmacist's skill or expertise.

## Ethics

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that helps decide what should be done in a principled sense besides what must be done to comply with laws. In the medical industry, universities, colleges, hospitals, and other organizations form Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) (or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)) to provide ethical guidance and ensure legal & ethical standards are followed. ERBs in hospitals can provide consultation for difficult ethical cases when they arise. Corporate compliance officers are responsible to investigate legal or ethical concerns identified in a business.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provide the following guidelines for compliance with federal and state law:

- the maintenance of written policies and procedures
- designation of a compliance officer and committee
- conducting effective training and education
- developing effective lines of communication
- auditing and monitoring
- enforcement through publicized disciplinary guidelines and policies dealing with ineligible persons
- responding to detected offenses, developing corrective action initiatives, and reporting to government authorities

Some basic values in ethical considerations include:

- **Autonomy** of the patient to choose their treatment
  - 🦅 *Federal law protects the patient's right to refuse treatment*
- **Beneficence** when treating patients
- **Dignification** of the patient
- **Non-Maleficence** when providing care
- **Justice** in healthcare
- **Honesty** in patient communication

## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- `If laws conflict, the stricter law must be followed.`

> 🦅 Federal law protects the patient's right to file complaints.

### Regulatory Bodies

During public health emergencies, HHS can expand access to care through guidance and waivers (e.g., authorizing technicians to administer vaccines).

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

### ⚖️ Court of Law

Judicial law has two main divisions:

- **Criminal Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to society
- **Civil Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to an individual

In civil law, there are two major subdivisions:

- **Contracts**: legal agreements that have duties associated with them
- **Torts**: civil wrongs that have duties associated with them, created by law

Torts are a branch of civil law in which the courts determine remedies for alleged harm suffered by people who have no formal relationship with the offender and the majority of court cases involving pharmacists are torts. These are typically **negligence lawsuits**, where a person or legal party who failed to use reasonable caution when providing care or services which resulted in damages to the victim. **Malpractice** is a type of negligence lawsuit brough against a person with a professional license.

## Duties

### Medication Safety

Preventing medication errors is an important goal of every pharmacy and, therefore, pharmacy technicians play an important role in preventing medication errors.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.
