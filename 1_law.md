## Compliance with the Law

Technicians are required to follow *state* & *federal* laws while working under the supervision of pharmacists. Technicians that fail to observe relevant law are punished alongside their supervising pharmacist.

### Regulatory Bodies

Laws in the USA are created and enforced on the state and federal level. ***Federal laws*** are enacted by *congress* if they pertain to federal matters; meaning they apply to the entirety of the United States. ***State Laws*** are are enacted by *legislatures* if they pertain to state; meaning that they only apply within the borders of that state. Generally speaking, if there are two conflicting laws, ***you must follow the stricter law***. Following both state and federal regulations is mandatory.

#### Federal Agencies

Two prominent *federal* agencies involved in the regulation of pharmacy are the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

- **The FDA** was established in 1938 by the ***Federal Food Drug & Cosmetics Act (FDCA)*** and is in charge of assuring the safety, efficacy, & quality of; drugs as well as medical devices; food, cosmetics, and supplements; and products that emit radiation.
- **The DEA** was established in 1973 as part of the ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA)*** of 1970 as its primary enforcement agency.

In addition to laws enforced by these agencies, there are federal laws regulating the treatment of patients that apply to various aspects of pharmacy. These laws guarantee certain rights for patients including: privacy & confidentiality; the right to file complaints; and the right to refuse treatment.

#### State Agencies

In each state, departments of professional regulation or state boards are responsible for licensing all prescribers and dispensers. There are also state boards of pharmacy that administer state regulations for the practice of pharmacy. In many states, non-physicians (e.g. nurse practitioners, dentists, vets, pharmacists, & physician assistants) have limited prescribing authority following protocol.

#### Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

There are various professional bodies and associations that set and maintain standards that get encoded into law.

- **American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)**: An accrediting organization for pharmacy residency & technician programs.
- **United States Pharmacopeia Convention (USP)**: A voluntary non-profit  that sets standards on manufacture & distribution of drugs & related products in the USA. These standards are adopted on the state and federal level in the *United States Pharmacopeia & National Formulary*.
- **The Joint Commission (TJC)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **The American Society for Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP)**: Sets standards for the practice of pharmacy who provide medication distribution and consultation for nursing homes.
- **The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC)**: Sets standards for pharmacies that provide services in the realm of: infusion, community retail, long-term care, & specialty pharmacy. They also administer the *Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB)* accreditation.
