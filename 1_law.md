# Chapter 1: Duties & Law for Pharmacy Technicians

Notes on general duties and laws to follow for pharmacy technicians.

## Scope of Practice

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the doctor's skill or expertise. A technician's general scope of practice generally includes:

- collecting patient information to build electronic profiles
- receiving prescriptions or medication orders from prescribers
- filling medications in accordance with those prescriptions
- compounding medications made to order for individual care
- ordering medication to replenish inventory
- retrieving expired or recalled medication for inventory control
- referring patients to the pharmacist for counsel

## Compliance with the Law

Technicians are required to follow *state* & *federal* laws while working under the supervision of pharmacists. Technicians that fail to observe relevant law are punished alongside their supervising pharmacist.

### Regulatory Bodies

Laws in the USA are created and enforced on the state and federal level. ***Federal laws*** are enacted by *congress* if they pertain to federal matters; meaning they apply to the entirety of the United States. ***State Laws*** are are enacted by *legislatures* if they pertain to state; meaning that they only apply within the borders of that state. Generally speaking, if there are two conflicting laws, ***you must follow the stricter law***. Following both state and federal regulations is mandatory.

#### Federal Agencies

Two prominent *federal* agencies involved in the regulation of pharmacy are the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

- **The FDA** was established in 1938 by the ***Federal Food Drug & Cosmetics Act (FDCA)*** and is in charge of assuring the safety, efficacy, & quality of; drugs as well as medical devices; food, cosmetics, and supplements; and products that emit radiation.
- **The DEA** was established in 1973 as part of the ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA)*** of 1970 as its primary enforcement agency.

In addition to laws enforced by these agencies, there are federal laws regulating the treatment of patients that apply to various aspects of pharmacy. These laws guarantee certain rights for patients including: privacy & confidentiality; the right to file complaints; and the right to refuse treatment.

#### State Agencies

In each state, departments of professional regulation or state boards are responsible for licensing all prescribers and dispensers. There are also state boards of pharmacy that administer state regulations for the practice of pharmacy. In many states, non-physicians (e.g. nurse practitioners, dentists, vets, pharmacists, & physician assistants) have limited prescribing authority following protocol.

#### Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

There are various professional bodies and associations that set and maintain standards that get encoded into law.

- **American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)**: An accrediting organization for pharmacy residency & technician programs.
- **United States Pharmacopeia Convention (USP)**: A voluntary non-profit  that sets standards on manufacture & distribution of drugs & related products in the USA. These standards are adopted on the state and federal level in the *United States Pharmacopeia & National Formulary*.
- **The Joint Commission (TJC)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **The American Society for Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP)**: Sets standards for the practice of pharmacy who provide medication distribution and consultation for nursing homes.
- **The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC)**: Sets standards for pharmacies that provide services in the realm of: infusion, community retail, long-term care, & specialty pharmacy. They also administer the *Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB)* accreditation.

## Important Legislation

### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA) of 1970

The OSHA was passed to ensure the safety of workers nationwide, including the pharmacy. Workers must be trained in safety measures and be provided Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when exposure to hazardous substances is possible. It also requires that Materials Safety Data Sheets (SDS) be made available to explain the risks of exposure and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

### The Health Information Privacy & Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996

HIPAA regulates how healthcare workers handle **Protected Health Information (PHI)**, which is any individually identifiable health information. This includes the manner of transmission and the contents of patient counseling when it includes enough information to identify the patient. Medical personnel must be trained periodically on HIPAA regulations to stay up to date and there must be a designated privacy officer appointed on duty.

#### Privacy Policy & Disclosures

Patients must be informed of their privacy rights, how the pharmacy handles information, and have access to their PHI records if requested.

##### Release of Information

Under HIPAA, medical personnel cannot disclose any PHI to anyone other than the patient unless the patient has given express consent, including spouses & relatives. One such form of consent is a Release of Information form that is typically used to transfer PHI to another healthcare facility or to receive for their personal use.

#### Violations

Violations must be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights: within 60 days of the end of a calender year if the breach affects less than 500 people; or within 60 days if it affects more.
