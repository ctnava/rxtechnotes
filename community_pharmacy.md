# Community Pharmacy

## Overview

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

- 🧾 **Independent Pharmacies**: Individually owned and operated, often serving local communities with personalized service.
- 🏬 **Chain Pharmacies**: National or regional pharmacy chains such as CVS or Walgreens.
- 🛒 **Mass Merchandiser Pharmacies**: Large retail chains like Walmart, Target, or Costco that have in-store pharmacies.
- 🥕 **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

🏥 **Walk-In Clinics**

Some pharmacy locations operate on-site clinics (e.g. CVS MinuteClinic or Walgreens Healthcare Clinic) staffed by:

- 👩‍⚕️ Nurse Practitioners (NPs)
- 🧑‍⚕️ Physician Assistants (PAs)

These clinics offer minor acute care services such as:

- Treatment for infections (e.g., strep throat, UTI)  
- Injury care (e.g., sprains, cuts)  
- Health screenings (e.g., blood pressure, glucose)  
- Routine immunizations (e.g., flu shots)

---

Pharmacy technicians may assist with:

- Patient intake and registration  
- Electronic health record (EHR) entry  
- Coordinating follow-up or referrals

Strong communication skills are essential in community pharmacy settings because pharmacy technicians working here are the most exposed to patients.

✅ Best practices:

- Listen actively and make eye contact  
- Confirm understanding by repeating concerns  
- Use a respectful, positive tone  
- Refer to patients by name when possible  
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone  
- Always follow facility policies and procedures  
- Refer all clinical questions to the pharmacist
