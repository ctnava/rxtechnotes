# Chapter 1: Pharmacies - Duties, Services, Law, & Ethics

<!-- ## Ethics

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that helps decide what should be done in a principled sense besides what must be done to comply with laws. In the medical industry, universities, colleges, hospitals, and other organizations form Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) (or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)) to provide ethical guidance and ensure legal & ethical standards are followed. ERBs in hospitals can provide consultation for difficult ethical cases when they arise. Corporate compliance officers are responsible to investigate legal or ethical concerns identified in a business.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provide the following guidelines for compliance with federal and state law:

- the maintenance of written policies and procedures
- designation of a compliance officer and committee
- conducting effective training and education
- developing effective lines of communication
- auditing and monitoring
- enforcement through publicized disciplinary guidelines and policies dealing with ineligible persons
- responding to detected offenses, developing corrective action initiatives, and reporting to government authorities

Some basic values in ethical considerations include:

- **Autonomy** of the patient to choose their treatment
  - 🦅 *Federal law protects the patient's right to refuse treatment*
- **Beneficence** when treating patients
- **Dignification** of the patient
- **Non-Maleficence** when providing care
- **Justice** in healthcare
- **Honesty** in patient communication -->

## Pharmacy Personnel

Pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians as support staff to assist with essential tasks that do not require the pharmacist's skill or expertise.

### Pharmacy Clerk/ Assistant

Pharmacy clerks (also called assistants) are **unlicensed personnel** who support front-end operations and customer service. They typically need only a high school diploma and on-the-job training. Their duties include:

- **Customer Service**: Greeting customers, answering phones, accepting prescriptions
- **Data Entry**: Inputting patient and insurance information into the pharmacy system
- **Inventory Tasks**: Stocking shelves, checking stock levels, receiving shipments
- **Payment Processing**: Handling customer payments and receipts
- **Clerical Work**: Filing records, organizing paperwork

> 🛑 **Note**: In some states, clerks may not be permitted to enter or access prescription data.

### Pharmacy Technicians (PhT)

Pharmacy technicians are **healthcare professionals** who assist pharmacists with technical tasks. In some states, techs are only registered, not licensed. At minimum states require that technicians are **registered (and usually licensed)**, while some employers may also require **national certification**. Their scope of practice typically includes:

- **Prescription Processing**: Receiving and processing medication orders, measuring and preparing dosages
- **Labeling**: Packaging and labeling medications with usage instructions
- **Insurance Processing**: Assisting with insurance claims and patient billing
- **Compounding**: Preparing sterile and non-sterile medications under pharmacist supervision
- **Patient Records**: Collecting and entering patient data into pharmacy systems
- **Inventory Management**: Monitoring stock and notifying pharmacists of shortages

### Pharmacist Interns

Interns are pharmacy students enrolled in a PharmD program and working under a **pharmacist’s supervision**. They typically hold an **intern license**. Responsibilities include:

- **Patient Interaction**: Taking medication histories and verifying prescriptions
- **Medication Prep**: Counting, packaging, and labeling prescriptions
- **Administrative Support**: Entering data, monitoring inventory, and maintaining records

### Pharmacist

Pharmacists are healthcare professionals licensed to **dispense medications**, **counsel patients**, and **oversee pharmacy operations**. They must hold a **Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)** degree and pass the **NAPLEX and MPJE** for licensure. Their duties include:

- **Prescription Review**: Ensuring accuracy, safety, and clarity in filled prescriptions
- **Patient Education**: Explaining medication use, side effects, and safety
- **Drug Interaction Checks**: Monitoring for potential medication conflicts
- **Administering Vaccines**: Providing immunizations (as allowed by state law)
- **Health Screenings**: Conducting blood pressure checks and other basic screenings

### (Situational) Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs)

NPs and PAs are **advanced practice providers** who are licensed to diagnose, treat, and prescribe medications. Their authority varies by state, but they often function similarly to physicians in outpatient settings.

- **Prescribing Authority**: Can write prescriptions for both non-controlled and controlled substances (depending on state law and DEA registration)
- **Collaborative Practice**: Often work under a supervising or collaborating physician
- **Vaccinations**: Can administer and prescribe vaccines
- **Pharmacy Role**: Pharmacy personnel often verify NP/PA credentials and DEA numbers when filling prescriptions

<!-- ## Compliance with the Law

All pharmacy personnel must comply with **federal and state laws**, under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist. Violations by technicians can also result in disciplinary actions for the supervising pharmacist.

- **Federal laws** are passed by Congress and apply nationwide.
- **State laws** are passed by individual legislatures and apply within their borders.
- If laws conflict, the **stricter law must be followed**.

> 🦅 Federal law protects the patient's right to file complaints.

### Regulatory Bodies

- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**: The primary federal agency responsible for protecting the health of all Americans. Oversees public health programs and agencies including the CDC, FDA, CMS, and NIH. During public health emergencies, HHS can expand access to care through guidance and waivers (e.g., authorizing technicians to administer vaccines).

#### State Agencies

Each state’s **Board of Pharmacy** is responsible for:

- Licensing pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
- Enforcing state-specific pharmacy regulations
- Granting limited prescribing rights to certain non-physician healthcare providers (e.g., NPs, PAs, pharmacists)

<!-- #### Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

While not government entities, these organizations shape pharmacy standards:

- **American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)**: Accredits pharmacy residencies and technician training programs
- **The Joint Commission (TJC)**: A non-profit that establishes standards & monitors compliance for healthcare programs in the US. TJC-accredited programs include hospitals, healthcare networks, HMOs, & nursing homes.
- **Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)**: A nonprofit organization devoted to preventing medication errors. ISMP develops safety alerts, best practices, and error-prevention strategies widely adopted in pharmacy and healthcare settings.

<!-- ### ⚖️ Court of Law

Judicial law has two main divisions:

- **Criminal Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to society
- **Civil Law**: laws pertaining to a wrong to an individual

In civil law, there are two major subdivisions:

- **Contracts**: legal agreements that have duties associated with them
- **Torts**: civil wrongs that have duties associated with them, created by law

Torts are a branch of civil law in which the courts determine remedies for alleged harm suffered by people who have no formal relationship with the offender and the majority of court cases involving pharmacists are torts. These are typically **negligence lawsuits**, where a person or legal party who failed to use reasonable caution when providing care or services which resulted in damages to the victim. **Malpractice** is a type of negligence lawsuit brough against a person with a professional license.

> **Emily's Law** refers to a piece of legislation that focused on improving the qualifications and training of pharmacy technicians after a medication error led to the death of a child, resulting from a malpractice lawsuit. The pharmacist did not catch this error and both were held liable.

### Important Legislation

Below are vital pieces of legislation to know as a pharmacy technician.

<!-- #### Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA, 1970)

Ensures workplace safety. Employers must:

- Train employees on safety protocols
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** when exposure to hazardous substances is possible
- Maintain **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** for all hazardous substances to explain the risks of exposure, handling instructions, and protocols necessary to prevent harm from such incidents.

> ⚠️ Chemotherapy agents and other hazardous drugs must have Safety Data Sheets! -->

<!-- #### The Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996)

🔗 [Expanded Detail](./law/hipaa.md)

- Protects **Protected Health Information (PHI)** handled by **Covered Entities**.
- Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure confidentiality.
- Mandates training, privacy officers, and compliance procedures.
- **Covered Entities**: Health plans, healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses.
- **PHI** includes any patient-identifiable health data (oral, written, electronic).
- Patients must receive and acknowledge a **Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)**.
- Providers identified by 10-digit **National Provider Identifier (NPI)**.

> 🚨 Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PHI is a **HIPAA violation**.
> 🔐 Breaches affecting 500+ individuals must be reported within **60 days**.
> ✅ Patients may request copies of their medical records (response required within **30 days**).

##### The Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act (HITECH, 2009)

- Expands HIPAA: includes **business associates** as regulated parties.
- Promotes the use of electronic health records (EHR) and **meaningful use** standards for health information technology infrastructure (e.g. electronic prescribing)
- Enforces secure **electronic data interchange (EDI)** for claims, billing, and patient data for HIPAA compliance

> ✅ HITECH strengthens enforcement and increases penalties for noncompliance. -->

## Services Offered

Certain federal laws have established pharmacist responsibilities that directly affect pharmacy operations, particularly in how pharmacists interact with patients and manage drug therapy. These laws also shape how pharmacy technicians support those processes.

### ❗❗❗ Counseling, Record Keeping, & Drug Utilization Review (DUR)

The **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-90, 1990)** was a major federal law affecting Medicaid prescription drug programs. It mandates that states receiving federal funds must require pharmacists to:

- 📄 **Maintain Patient Medication Profiles**: Pharmacies must maintain records (on-site for a minimum of 2 years) of a patient’s medication history to support counseling and DUR obligations.
- 📋 **Conduct DURs**: Evaluate prescriptions to identify adverse effects, therapeutic duplication, drug–disease contraindications, incorrect dosage or duration, and drug–drug interactions.
- 💬 **Offer Counseling to Medicaid Patients**: Pharmacists must “offer to counsel” Medicaid patients on:
  - Proper use of the medication
  - Potential side effects or adverse reactions
  - Storage instructions
  - What to do in case of a missed dose
  - 📁 **Document Counseling Offers**: While OBRA-90 requires the offer, specific documentation requirements (such as signed refusals) vary by state.

> ⚠️ Some states have extended OBRA-90 requirements to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients.

A process to ensure the most accurate, complete list of all medications a patient is taking—name, dose, route, and frequency—by comparing current medical records with patient and provider sources.  

Especially critical for:

- Emergency Department admissions
- Hospitalist-managed patients
- Patients with **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
- Transfers from **Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**

### 💊 Medication Therapy Management (MTM)

The **Medicare Modernization Act (MMA, 2003)** established Part D of the program to provide prescription drug coverage and requires pharmacists to provide **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)** services to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. These include:

- **Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs)**: Reviewing all medications a patient is taking
- Identifying duplications or interactions
- Providing personalized medication action plans
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes
- Monitoring side effects and adherence
- Coordinating care with prescribers

> **NOTE**: MTM is usually targeted toward patients taking multiple chronic medications, especially those with multiple conditions or high drug costs.

Technicians assist by preparing medication histories, documentation, and assisting with insurance or billing tasks.

> 📨 **HIPAA**: Requires all patient health information (PHI) obtained during Counseling, DSM, MTM services to be kept strictly confidential.

#### 🩺 Disease State Management (DSM)

Pharmacists provide **Disease State Management** services to help patients with chronic conditions understand and manage their illnesses. Common conditions include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Hyperlipidemia

DSM programs often involve patient counseling, medication adherence support, lifestyle education, and clinical monitoring. Technicians support DSM by scheduling appointments, preparing documentation, and assisting with data collection.

> ⚖️ DSM is **not mandated by federal law**, but it is commonly implemented under **MTM programs (via MMA, 2003)** and **state Medicaid or managed care plans**.

### 💉 Vaccines

Vaccines help your body build protection against infectious diseases by "teaching" your immune system to recognize and respond to viruses or bacteria. Herd Immunity is a phenomenon where a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to a disease, indirectly protecting those who are not immune; which is critical for the protection of public health.

To support public health through vaccine efforts, pharmacies offer immunization services.
