# Introduction to Pharmacy

**Pharmacology** is the study of how drugs interact with biological systems, including their effects, mechanisms of action, metabolism, and excretion.

It differs from:

- **Pharmacognosy**, which focuses on drugs from natural sources, and
- **Pharmaceutics**, which focuses on formulation and delivery of drug products.

## The State of Modern Medicine

Since **1900**, the average lifespan in the United States has increased by over **30 years**. This improvement is largely due to:

- Advancements in pharmaceuticals and vaccines
- Widespread use of antibiotics
- Improved public health infrastructure
- Better hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition

Between **1970 and 2000**, healthcare spending in the U.S. increased by more than **1500%**, driven by:

- More advanced diagnostic tools and treatments
- Greater use of prescription drugs
- Expanded access to medical services
- Longer life expectancy with more chronic disease management

Most drugs used in modern medicine are **synthetic**, meaning they are chemically manufactured rather than directly derived from natural sources.

- Synthetic drugs are generally more consistent, cost-effective, scalable, and easier to modify for improved performance.
- Advances in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry, and computational modeling enable precise design and testing of these compounds.

🦅 **FDA Oversight**

- All prescription and OTC drugs in the U.S. are regulated by the **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**.
- The FDA is responsible for:
  - Ensuring drugs are **safe**, **effective**, and **labeled properly**
  - Monitoring for **adverse drug reactions**
  - **Recalling** dangerous or defective products
  - Reviewing **clinical trial data** before approving new drugs

🧠 **Intellectual Property & R&D**

- Pharmaceutical companies receive **patents** for new drug discoveries, which typically last **20 years** from the date of filing.
- Patents give manufacturers exclusive rights to sell the drug, preventing generic competition and allowing recovery of **research and development (R&D)** costs due to **10–12 years due to development time**.
- On average, companies invest around **1/6 of their revenue** into R&D, funding the discovery of future treatments and innovations.

### The Practice of Pharmacy

To become a **pharmacist** in the United States, an individual must:

- Graduate from an **ACPE-accredited Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program**
- Complete a **supervised internship** or **experiential rotations** (Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences, or IPPEs and APPEs)
- Pass national and state-level **licensing exams**, including:
  - The **NAPLEX** (North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination)
  - The **MPJE** (Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination), or a state-specific law exam

Pharmacists must complete **Continuing Education (CE)** regularly to maintain licensure.

- CE requirements vary by state, but typically include a mix of clinical, legal, and safety topics.
- Some states require CE on specific topics like opioid safety or immunizations.

💊 **Medication Therapy Management (MTM)**

- MTM services involve a comprehensive review of **all medications** a patient is taking, including prescriptions, OTCs, supplements, and herbals.
- Pharmacists identify **interactions**, **duplications**, **adherence issues**, and **cost-saving opportunities**.
- MTM is especially beneficial for patients with chronic illnesses, polypharmacy, or high medication costs.
- Pharmacists are reimbursed for MTM at rates averaging **$1–$3 per minute** of consultation.

🖥️ **Computerized Pharmacy Management Systems (PMS)**

- Store and manage key pharmacy data:
  - Patient profiles
  - Drug information
  - Inventory and ordering
  - Pricing and insurance processing
- Automate tasks such as:
  - Drug interaction checks
  - Label printing
  - Refill reminders
  - Claim submission
- Improve accuracy, efficiency, and throughput—allowing pharmacies to **dispense more prescriptions** with fewer errors.
- 🛡️ Support compliance with state and federal laws regarding:
  - Recordkeeping
  - Inventory tracking (especially for controlled substances)
  - Reporting requirements (e.g., to prescription drug monitoring programs or insurers)
