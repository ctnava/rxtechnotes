# 🌡️ Temperature Scale Conversions

| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C) | ${C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)}$ |
| Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) | ${F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32}$ |

> 📍 Tip: Subtract/add 32, then scale by 5/9 or 9/5 depending on direction.

🔁 **Practice Conversions**

| Example | Math |
|---------|------|
| Convert 100°F to °C | ${C = \frac{5}{9}(100 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(68) = 37.8^\circ C}$ |
| Convert 4°C to °F | ${F = \frac{9}{5}(4) + 32 = 7.2 + 32 = 39.2^\circ F}$ |

✅ **Common Benchmarks to Memorize**

| °C | Description              | °F   |
|----|--------------------------|------|
| 0  | Freezing point of water  | 32   |
| 20 | Room temperature         | 68   |
| 25 | Pharmacy room temp       | 77   |
| 37 | Human body temperature   | 98.6 |
| 100| Boiling point of water   | 212  |

> 📍 Pharmacy refrigerators are typically set between **2°C and 8°C** (36°F–46°F)

## 🛡️ Best Practices

- Always include units (°F or °C) to avoid dangerous confusion
- Use exact formulas in clinical settings, especially for:
  - Vaccine storage
  - Drug compounding
  - Fever thresholds
- Know the Celsius equivalents for **normal body temp (37°C)** and **fever (>38°C)**

## 🧠 Mental Math

`Not precise but useful for estimates`

| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| °F → °C | ${(F - 30) \div 2}$ |
| °C → °F | ${(C \times 2) + 30}$ |

> 🚨 Shortcuts are for estimation only. Always use full formula for clinical accuracy.

## ⚓ Density & Specific Gravity

Understanding **density** and **specific gravity (SG)** is essential for pharmacy technicians when converting between **weight (grams)** and **volume (milliliters)**. These concepts are especially relevant for compounding, labeling, and interpreting formulas involving **liquids that are not water** because:

- Many drugs are dosed or dispensed in **volume** but labeled in **weight**
- **Non-aqueous solutions** (like ethanol or glycerin) don’t follow the 1 g = 1 mL "rule"
- Knowing the **density** or **SG** allows accurate conversions between **g ↔ mL**

| Term | Definition | Units |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Density** | Mass per unit volume. | Commonly expressed as **g/mL** in pharmacy. |
| **Specific Gravity (SG)** | Ratio of a substance’s density to the density of water. | **No units** (it's a ratio). |

📍 **Used when**:

- Measuring solvents in compounding
- Calculating dosages from weight-based orders
- Understanding concentration of liquid formulations

> 🚨 **SG is a dimensionless number** because it's a ratio. Since water’s density is 1 g/mL at standard conditions, the SG is **numerically equal** to the density for most pharmacy applications—but not always interchangeable when units are required.

🌡️ **Common Liquid Densities and Specific Gravities**

| Substance | Density (g/mL) | Specific Gravity (SG) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Water** | 1.00           | 1.00                   |
| **Ethanol** | 0.79         | 0.79                   |
| **Glycerin** | 1.26        | 1.26                   |

>- ✅ These values are typical at room temperature (20°C to 25°C)
>- 🔁 SG can substitute for density (in g/mL) when comparing to water.

🧪 **Example: What is the weight in grams of 15 mL of ethanol?**

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Given volume | 15 mL |
| Density of ethanol | 0.79 g/mL |
| Multiply | 15 × 0.79 = 11.85 g |

🧪 **Example: What volume in mL is 5 g of glycerin?**

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Given mass | 5 g |
| Density of glycerin | 1.26 g/mL |
| Divide | 5 ÷ 1.26 ≈ 3.97 mL |

### 🛡️ Make Sure to

- Always check whether the substance is **water** or something else
- If SG is given instead of density, you can treat it as **g/mL** for pharmacy conversions
- Round **only at the final step**
- Clearly label your **units** in all work
