# ⚖️ Alligation Calculations for Pharmacy Technicians

## 🔑 Key Concepts

**Alligation** is a method used to determine how to combine **two strengths** (concentrations) of the **same ingredient** to achieve a **desired strength** (concentration) that falls **between** the two.

It is a shortcut technique (often visualized like a tic-tac-toe grid) to avoid solving with full algebra.

Use **alligation** when:

- You are **mixing two known strengths** of the **same active ingredient**
- You need to make a **specific final strength**
- The **desired strength lies between the two** known strengths
- This **dilutions** (use 0%)

You **cannot** use alligation if:

- The desired strength is **not between** the two available strengths
- The solutions contain **different ingredients**

### 🔢 Formulas

#### 🧩 Table Setup

| $C_h$ | | ${P_h = C_d - C_l}$ |
|-|-|-|
| | $C_d$ | |
| $C_l$  | | ${P_l = C_h - C_d}$ |

> The numbers on the diagonals are always subtractive differences. Always subtract "across" the grid.

Where:

${\boxed{\text{Higher, Available Strength } (\% \times 100) = C_h}}$

${\boxed{\text{Lower, Available Strength } (\% \times 100) = C_l}}$

${\boxed{\text{Desired Strength } (\% \times 100) = C_d}}$

${\boxed{\text{Higher Strength in Final Solution (Parts)} = P_h}}$

${\boxed{\text{Lower Strength in Final Solution (Parts)} = P_l}}$

#### 🧩 Determining Ratios of Each

${\boxed{\text{Sum of All (Parts)} = P_s} = P_h + P_l}$

${\boxed{\implies \text{Ratio of Higher Strength } (R_h)= \frac{P_h}{P_s}}}$

${\boxed{\implies \text{Ratio of Lower Strength } (R_l)= \frac{P_l}{P_s}}}$

#### 🧩 Determining Volumes of Each

${\boxed{\text{Total Volume (mL)} = V_t\ (\text{Given})}}$

${\boxed{\implies \text{Higher Strength Volume } (V_h) = R_h \times V_t = (\frac{P_h}{P_s}) \times V_t}}$

${\boxed{\implies \text{Lower Strength Volume } (V_l) = R_l \times V_t = (\frac{P_l}{P_s}) \times V_t}}$

## 📍 Tips and Best Practices

- 🛡️ Always check that the desired concentration/ strength is **between** the two available.
- 📏 Keep units consistent: mL with mL, g with g.
- ✅ Use exact math before rounding unless a sig fig limit is specified.
- 🤯 Alligation gives **ratios**, not volumes—convert with total quantity.
- 🧮 Don't forget to **sum parts** when scaling to actual quantities.
