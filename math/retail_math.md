# Retail Calculations

## 💸 Usual and Customary (U&C) Pricing

**Usual and Customary (U&C) Price** is the **standard cash price** a pharmacy charges **when the patient is not using insurance or any third-party coverage**.

- 💸 This is the **price the pharmacy sets** for self-pay (cash-paying) customers.
- 🛡️ Third-party payers often **cap reimbursement at the U&C price** if it's lower than their calculated payment.
- 🏢 Typically **set by corporate offices**, but **some pharmacies may calculate it manually** using a formula programmed into their dispensing software.

### 🧮 How U&C Price Is Determined

The U&C price is determined by the **pharmacy**, not by manufacturers or insurers, and is based on a combination of the following elements:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AWP** | 🦅 Average Wholesale Price. A benchmark price published by commercial compendia. |
| **Acquisition Cost** | What the pharmacy actually paid to obtain the medication. |
| **Professional Fee** | A set amount added to cover dispensing, labor, and business costs. |

The **Basic Selling Price Formula** (for internal or manual U&C pricing):

`Selling Price = AWP + Professional Fee`

> 📍 This formula may be programmed into pharmacy systems to automatically calculate U&C pricing for less-common medications.

### 🦅x🐻 Third Party Reimbursement: The "Lesser Of" Rule

Insurance plans and third-party payers often reimburse based on the lowest of:

- AWP
- Acquisition Cost + dispensing fee
- U&C (cash price)

> 🚨 **Important**: If your pharmacy’s U&C price is **lower** than AWP-based reimbursement, **you get paid the U&C price**. Setting your U&C too low **reduces revenue**.

### 📊 Example: Determining the U&C Selling Price

Use the following table to determine the **professional fee** based on the AWP:

| **AWP Range**       | **Professional Fee** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Less than $20       | $4.00                |
| $20.01 – $50.00     | $10.00               |
| More than $50.00    | $15.00               |

#### Q: What is the selling price if the AWP for 30 capsules is $3.50?

- AWP = **$3.50**
- Falls under "**Less than $20**" → Add **$4.00** professional fee

`Selling Price = $3.50 + $4.00 = $7.50`

### 🧪 Example: Third-Party Claim Calculation

**Scenario:**  
The pharmacy has a contract for reimbursement as:

> **87% AWP or 100% U&C, whichever is less, + $4.50 dispensing fee**

Medication: **Humulin N U-100 (10 mL)**  

- AWP = **$33.75**  
- U&C = **$43.00**

#### Step 1: Calculate 87% of AWP  

`0.87 x 33.75 = 29.3625`

#### Step 2: Compare U&C  

- U&C = **$43.00** → higher than 87% AWP

Use **lower** of the two = **$29.36**

#### Step 3: Add Dispensing Fee  

`29.36 + 4.50 = 33.86`

Total third-party reimbursement = **$33.86**

## 💸 Calculating Discounts

A **discount** is a **reduction** from the regular (usual and customary) price of a product or service. In pharmacy settings, discounts are sometimes extended to cash-paying customers, such as:

- 🧓 **Senior citizens without insurance**
- 💊 **Cash-paying patients on promotional days**
- 🚫 Patients **not using third-party coverage**

> 🐻 **California law and third-party agreements** may prohibit discounting for prescriptions covered by insurance or government programs (e.g. Medi-Cal, Medicare Part D). Always check before applying a discount.

### 🧮 How to Calculate a Percentage Discount

To apply a percentage discount:

`Discount Amount = Original Price x (Discount %)/100`

`Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount Amount`

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- 🦅x🐻 Never apply discounts to prescriptions **covered by third-party payers** unless explicitly allowed.
- 📍 Always verify **store policy**, **contractual obligations**, and **state laws** before offering any price reductions.
- ✅ Discounts should be **clearly documented** and applied consistently.

### 📊 Discount Examples

#### ✅ Example 1: 10% Discount on $8.49

- Original Price: $8.49  
- Discount: 10%

`Discount Amount = 8.49 x 0.10 = 0.849`

`Discounted Price = 8.49 - 0.849 = 7.64`

Final price = **$7.64**

#### ✅ Example 2: 5% Discount on $74.27

- Original Price: $74.27  
- Discount: 5%

`Discount Amount = 74.27 x 0.05 = 3.7135`

`Discounted Price = 74.27 - 3.7135 = 70.56`

Final price = **$70.56**

#### ✅ Example 3: 5% Discount on $121.45

- Original Price: $121.45  
- Discount: 5%

`Discount Amount = 121.45 x 0.05 = 6.0725`

`Discounted Price = 121.45 - 6.0725 = 115.38`

Final price = **$115.38**

#### ✅ Example 4: 10% Discount on $195.20

- Original Price: $195.20  
- Discount: 10%

`Discounted Amount = 195.20 x 0.10 = 19.52`

`Discounted Price = 195.20 - 19.52 = 175.68`

Final price = **$175.68**

## 📈 Gross Profit & Net Profit

Calculating profits helps determine whether the **pharmacy is losing money** on a prescription. Even if a third-party reimburses according to contract, the **actual profit could be negative** if operational costs exceed revenue.

### 🔑 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Acquisition Cost** | The amount the **pharmacy pays** to purchase a drug. |
| **Selling Price** | The amount the **pharmacy charges** for the prescription. |
| **Gross Profit** | The difference between **selling price and acquisition cost**. No other costs are considered. |
| **Net Profit** | The difference between **selling price and all costs associated** with filling the prescription, usually estimated by adding a **dispensing fee**. |

### 🧮 Formulas

✅ **Gross Profit**

`Gross Profit = Selling Price - Acquisition Cost`

`Gross Profit % = (Gross Profit / Selling Price) x 100`

✅ **Net Profit**

`Net Profit = Gross Profit - Dispensing Fee`

`Net Profit = (Selling Price - Acquisition Cost) + Dispensing Fee`

`Net Profit %  = (Net Profit / Selling Price) x 100`

> 📍 Dispensing fee is a practical estimate of all other operational costs, including labor, container, label, rent, and overhead.

### 📊 Profit Examples

#### 🧪 Example 1

- UC Price (Selling Price): $8.49  
- Acquisition Cost: $2.02  
- Dispensing Fee: $5.50

🔹 **Gross Profit**

`Gross Profit = 8.49 - 2.02 = 6.47`

`Gross Profit % = (6.47/8.49) x 100 = 76.2%`

🔹 **Net Profit**

`Net Profit = 8.49 - (2.02 + 5.50) = 8.49 - 7.52 = 0.97`

`Net Profit % = (0.97/8.49) x 100 = 11.4%`

#### 🧪 Example 2

- Selling Price: $92.99  
- Acquisition Cost: $77.20  
- Dispensing Fee: $6.00

🔹 **Gross Profit**

`Gross Profit = 92.99 - 77.20 = 15.79`

`Gross Profit % = (15.79/92.99) x 100 = 17.0%`

🔹 **Net Profit**

`Net Profit = 92.99 - (77.20 + 6.00) = 92.99 - 83.20 = 9.79`

`Net Profit % = (9.79/92.99) x 100 = 10.5%`
