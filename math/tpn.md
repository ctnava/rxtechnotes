**Parenteral Nutrition (PN)** is the administration of **nutrients directly into the bloodstream** through intravenous (IV) infusion. It is used for patients who cannot obtain adequate nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract.

**Hyperalimentation Solution** is a synonym for parenteral nutrition, particularly when **high-calorie** or **nutrient-dense** solutions are required.

ü©∫ **Clinical Indications**

- Severe GI disease or obstruction
- Malabsorption or short bowel syndrome
- Hyperemesis gravidarum
- Major surgery, trauma, or burns
- Inability to meet nutritional needs enterally
- Cancer with GI involvement

| Characteristic | TPN (Total PN) | PPN (Partial PN) |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| üß† Purpose | Complete nutrition | Supplement oral/enteral intake |
| üíâ Route | Central venous catheter | Peripheral IV line |
| üß™ Osmolarity | > 900 mOsm/L | < 900 mOsm/L |
| üß± Base Solutions | Dextrose 15‚Äì35%, Amino Acids 3‚Äì10% | Dextrose ‚â§10%, Amino Acids 2.5‚Äì5% |
| üßÇ Additives | Full electrolyte, vitamin, trace mix | Limited electrolytes, vitamins |
| üì¶ Volume | Large volume (1‚Äì3 L/day) | Smaller volume (typically <2 L/day) |

## üß© Components of PN Solutions

Parenteral nutrition consists of a **base solution** and a **set of additives**. PN may be formulated in two ways:

- **Standard Formulation**: Pre-developed by institutional protocols; appropriate for most adult patients
- **Patient-Specific Formulation**: Custom-compounded based on laboratory values, disease states, and patient-specific nutritional needs

### üß± Base Solutions (Macronutrients)

| Component | Function | Typical Concentration | Caloric Yield | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------|---------------|-------|
| Dextrose | Carbohydrate | 10%‚Äì70% | 3.4 kcal/g | Major energy source |
| Amino Acids | Protein | 3.5%‚Äì15% | 4 kcal/g | Products: Aminosyn, Travasol |
| Lipid Emulsion | Fat | 10% & 20% | 1.1‚Äì2 kcal/mL | Optional; not always admixed |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **3-in-1 formulations** contain dextrose, amino acids, and lipids in a single bag. **2-in-1 formulations** exclude lipids and are often supplemented with lipids separately.

### üíä Additives (Micronutrients)

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Electrolytes | Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫, Cl‚Åª, Mg¬≤‚Å∫, PO‚ÇÑ¬≥‚Åª, Ca¬≤‚Å∫ | Must monitor serum levels and renal function |
| Vitamins | MVI (multi-vitamin infusion) | Added daily to support metabolic function |
| Trace Elements | Zinc, Copper, Chromium, Manganese, Selenium | Typically added as a multi-trace element formulation |
| Medications | Insulin, H2 blockers (e.g. ranitidine) | Included based on patient-specific need and compatibility |
| Diluent | SWFI | Diluent; Adjusts final osmolarity |

üö® **Important Compatibility Note**:  
Calcium and phosphate can **precipitate** if not managed carefully. To minimize this risk:

- Add **phosphate first** to allow for dilution
- Add **calcium last**
- Maintain **appropriate temperature, pH, and total volume**
- Ensure pharmacist approval before mixing
