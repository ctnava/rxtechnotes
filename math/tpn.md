## 🔑 Key Definitions

- **Parenteral Nutrition (PN)**: The administration of **nutrients directly into the bloodstream** through intravenous (IV) infusion. It is used for patients who cannot obtain adequate nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Hyperalimentation Solution**: A synonym for parenteral nutrition, particularly when **high-calorie** or **nutrient-dense** solutions are required.

| Characteristic | TPN (Total PN) | PPN (Partial PN) |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 🧠 Purpose | Complete nutrition | Supplement oral/enteral intake |
| 💉 Route | Central venous catheter | Peripheral IV line |
| 🧪 Osmolarity | > 900 mOsm/L | < 900 mOsm/L |
| 🧱 Base Solutions | Dextrose 15–35%, Amino Acids 3–10% | Dextrose ≤10%, Amino Acids 2.5–5% |
| 🧂 Additives | Full electrolyte, vitamin, trace mix | Limited electrolytes, vitamins |
| 📦 Volume | Large volume (1–3 L/day) | Smaller volume (typically <2 L/day) |

## 🧩 Components of PN Solutions

### 🧱 Base Solutions (Macronutrients)

- **Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI)**: used to dilute hypertonic solutions
- **Dextrose** (carbohydrate source)  
  - Common concentrations: D10W, D20W, D50W, etc.  
  - Provides 3.4 kcal/g
- **Amino Acids** (protein source)  
  - Products: e.g. Aminosyn 3%, 5%, 10%  
  - Provides 4 kcal/g
- **IV Fat Emulsion (Lipid)** (fat source)  
  - 10% = 1.1 kcal/mL  
  - 20% = 2 kcal/mL  
  - May be given separately (3-in-1 = all macronutrients together)

### 💊 Additives (Micronutrients)

| Type             | Examples                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Electrolytes     | Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, Mg²⁺, PO₄³⁻, Ca²⁺              |
| Vitamins         | MVI (multi-vitamin infusion)                 |
| Trace Elements   | Zinc, Copper, Chromium, Manganese, Selenium |
| Other Additives  | Insulin, H2 blockers (e.g. ranitidine)       |
