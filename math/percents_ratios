# ðŸ§® Percents & Ratios

## ðŸ’¯ Percent Strength

**Percent strength** is a common way to express the concentration of a solution in pharmacy. Understanding how to calculate, interpret, and manipulate percentages is essential for compounding, dilutions, and preparing medications accurately.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Percent Strength (% w/v)** | Number of grams of solute in 100 mL of solution. Most common in pharmacy. |
| **% w/v** | Weight in volume (grams per 100 mL) â€” used for solids dissolved in liquids. |
| **% v/v** | Volume in volume (mL per 100 mL) â€” used for liquids in liquids. |
| **% w/w** | Weight in weight (grams per 100 g) â€” used for ointments or creams. |

> ðŸš¨ Unless otherwise specified, % strength refers to % w/v in pharmacy practice.

### ðŸ§ª Example 1: Determine Percent Strength from Ingredients and Volume

**Question**: What is the % strength of a solution made by dissolving 12 g of NaCl in enough water to make 400 mL of solution?

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1: Use formula | ${\%\ \text{w/v} = \frac{\text{g of solute}}{\text{mL of solution}} \times 100}$ |
| 2: Plug in values | ${\frac{\text{12 g}}{\text{400 mL}} \times 100 = \boxed{3\%}}$ |
| âœ… Final Answer | The solution is **3% NaCl**. |

### ðŸ§ª Example 2: Calculate Volume from Weight and Percent Strength

**Question**: How much solution can be prepared from 10 g of salicylic acid to make a 2% solution?

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1: Use the formula | ${\%\ \text{w/v} = \frac{\text{g of solute}}{100\ \text{mL}}}$ |
| 2: Use the definition | ${2\% = \frac{\text{2 grams}}{\text{100 mL}}}$ |
| 3: Set up proportion | ${\frac{\text{2 grams}}{\text{100 mL}} = \frac{\text{10 grams}}{\text{x mL}}}$ |
| 4: Rearrange to solve for volume | ${\text{x mL} = \frac{\text{10 grams} \times \text{100 mL}}{\text{2 grams}} = \boxed{500\ \text{mL}}}$  |
| âœ… Final Answer | You can prepare **500 mL** of a 2% salicylic acid solution from 10 g of the drug. |

### ðŸ§ª Example 3: Calculate Amount of Drug in Volume of Solution

**Question**: How many grams of boric acid are in 180 mL of a 4% solution?

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1: Use the formula | ${\%\ \text{w/v} = \frac{\text{g of solute}}{100\ \text{mL}}}$ |
| 2: Use the definition | ${4\% = \frac{\text{4 grams}}{\text{100 mL}}}$ |
| 3: Set up proportion | ${\frac{\text{4 grams}}{\text{100 mL}} = \frac{\text{x grams}}{\text{180 mL}}}$ |
| 4: Rearrange to solve for mass | ${\text{x grams} = \frac{\text{4 grams} \times \text{180 mL}}{\text{100 mL}} = \boxed{7.2\ \text{g}}}$ |
| âœ… Final Answer | The 180 mL contains **7.2 g** of boric acid. |

### Example 4: Calculate How Much of a Concentrated Solution is Needed

Question: How much of a 25% stock solution is required to prepare 200 mL of a 5% solution?

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1: Interpret 5% target | ${5\% = \frac{\text{5 grams}}{\text{100 mL}}}$ |
| 2: Determine how much drug is found in 200 mL | ${\frac{\text{5 grams}}{\text{100 mL}} = \frac{x\ \text{g}}{200\ \text{mL}} \Rightarrow \text{x grams} = \frac{\text{5 grams} \times \text{200 mL}}{\text{100 mL}} = \boxed{10\ \text{g}}}$  |
| 3: Interpret 25% stock | ${25\% = \frac{\text{25 grams}}{\text{100 mL}}}$ |
| 4: Set up proportion to find how much of the stock contains 10 g | ${\frac{25\ \text{g}}{100\ \text{mL}} = \frac{\text{10 grams}}{\text{x mL}} \Rightarrow \text{x mL} = \frac{\text{10 grams} \times \text{100 mL}}{\text{25 grams}} = \boxed{40\ \text{mL}}}$ |
| âœ… Final Answer | Use **40 mL** of 25% stock solution and add **160 mL** of diluent to make 200 mL of 5% solution. |
