# 📐 Unit Conversions for Pharmacy Technicians

Unit conversions in pharmacy are grounded in **dimensional analysis**; a technique where you multiply by conversion factors to cancel units systematically. This helps convert between any two units in a structured, error-resistant way.

## 🔄 Basic Conversion Concept: Canceling Units

🔑 **Key Ideas**:

- Set up your units so **the unit you want to cancel is opposite (numerator vs. denominator)**
- Multiply straight across numerators and denominators
- Cancel and simplify

> 📌 This principle applies broadly—across volume, weight, dosage, rate, and more.

| Example: Miles per Hour × Time = Distance |
|---------|
| If a vehicle travels at **60 miles/hour** for **2 hours** |
| $\frac{60\ \text{miles}}{1\ \text{hour}} \times \frac{2\ \text{hours}}{1} = \frac{60 \times 2\ \text{miles}}{1} = 120\ \text{miles}$ |

> 📌 Hours cancel out because they appear once in the numerator and once in the denominator.

## 🥄 Household and Metric Conversions

Conversions commonly used in pharmacy can be broken down into **volume** and **weight**.

### 🧪 Volume Conversions

| Conversion (Household) | Equals |
|------------------------|--------|
| 1 gallon (gal)     | 4 quarts (qt) |
| 1 quart (qt)       | 2 pints (pt) |
| 1 pint (pt)        | 16 ounces (oz) |
| 1 ounce (oz)       | 2 tablespoons (tbsp) |
| 1 tablespoon (tbsp)| 3 teaspoons (tsp) |

| Conversion (Metric) | Equals |
|---------------------|--------|
| 1 liter (L)         | 1000 milliliters (mL) |

| Conversion (Household-Metric) | Equals |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1 pint (pt)                   | 480 mL |
| 1 ounce (oz)                  | 30 mL |
| 1 tbsp                        | 15 mL |
| 1 tsp                         | 5 mL |

### ⚖️ Weight Conversions

| Conversion (Household) | Equals |
|------------------------|--------|
| 1 pound (lb)           | 16 ounces (oz) |

| Conversion (Metric) | Equals |
|---------------------|--------|
| 1 kilogram (kg)     | 1000 grams (g) |
| 1 gram (g)          | 1000 milligrams (mg) |
| 1 milligram (mg)    | 1000 micrograms (mcg) |
| 1 kg                | 1,000,000 mcg |

| Conversion (Household-Metric) | Equals |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1 kg                          | 2.2 lbs |
| 1 lb                          | 0.454 kg |
| 1 lb                          | 454 g |

> - 📌 Know both household → metric and metric → household conversions.
> - 📌 Metric conversions are base-10: just move the decimal point.

### 🧪 Example: Convert 1 gallon to mL (step-by-step)

We will convert 1 gallon to milliliters by **chaining units**, canceling each one along the way.

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1: Convert to quarts | ${1\ \text{gal} \times \frac{4\ \text{qt}}{1\ \text{gal}} = 4\ \text{qt}}$ |
| 2: Convert to pints | ${4\ \text{qt} \times \frac{2\ \text{pt}}{1\ \text{qt}} = 8\ \text{pt}}$ |
| 3: Convert to ounces | ${8\ \text{pt} \times \frac{16\ \text{oz}}{1\ \text{pt}} = 128\ \text{oz}}$ |
| 4: Convert to tablespoons | ${128\ \text{oz} \times \frac{2\ \text{tbsp}}{1\ \text{oz}} = 256\ \text{tbsp}}$ |
| 5: Convert to teaspoons | ${256\ \text{tbsp} \times \frac{3\ \text{tsp}}{1\ \text{tbsp}} = 768\ \text{tsp}}$ |
| 6: Convert to mL | ${768\ \text{tsp} \times \frac{5\ \text{mL}}{1\ \text{tsp}} = \boxed{3840\ \text{mL}}}$ |
| 7: Final Answer | 1 gallon = 3840 mL |

### ✅ Best Practices

- Write out all units and cancel as you go
- Round **only at the end**
- Use only verified, standard conversion values
- Understand both directions: household → metric and metric → household

### 💊 Dose Calculations with Ratios and Proportions

In pharmacy, you will frequently calculate doses using ratio and proportion.

#### 🧪 Example: Units of Insulin Administered from Volume

| Step | Math |
|------|------|
| 1 (preferred): Convert weight to kg | ${205\ \text{lbs} \div \frac{2.2\ \text{lbs}}{1\ \text{kg}} \approx 93.18\ \text{kg}}$ |
| 1 (alt): Convert weight to kg | ${205\ \text{lbs} \times \frac{1\ \text{kg}}{2.2\ \text{lbs}} \approx 93.18\ \text{kg}}$ |
| 2: Calculate total daily dose | ${30\ \text{mg/kg/day} \times 93.18\ \text{kg} = 2795.45\ \text{mg/day}}$ |
| 3: Divide into 4 doses | ${\frac{2795.45\ \text{mg/day}}{4} \approx \boxed{698.86\ \text{mg per dose}} \approx \boxed{700\ \text{mg per dose\ (rounded)}}}$ |
| 4: Final Answer | Administer 700 mg every 6 hours |

## ⚓ Density & Specific Gravity

Understanding **density** and **specific gravity (SG)** is essential for pharmacy technicians when converting between **weight (grams)** and **volume (milliliters)**. These concepts are especially relevant for compounding, labeling, and interpreting formulas involving **liquids that are not water** because:

- Many drugs are dosed or dispensed in **volume** but labeled in **weight**
- **Non-aqueous solutions** (like ethanol or glycerin) don’t follow the 1 g = 1 mL "rule"
- Knowing the **density** or **SG** allows accurate conversions between **g ↔ mL**

| Term | Definition | Units |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Density** | Mass per unit volume. | Commonly expressed as **g/mL** in pharmacy. |
| **Specific Gravity (SG)** | Ratio of a substance’s density to the density of water. | **No units** (it's a ratio). |

📍 **Used when**:

- Measuring solvents in compounding
- Calculating dosages from weight-based orders
- Understanding concentration of liquid formulations

> 🚨 **SG is a dimensionless number** because it's a ratio. Since water’s density is 1 g/mL at standard conditions, the SG is **numerically equal** to the density for most pharmacy applications—but not always interchangeable when units are required.

🌡️ **Common Liquid Densities and Specific Gravities**

| Substance | Density (g/mL) | Specific Gravity (SG) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Water** | 1.00           | 1.00                   |
| **Ethanol** | 0.79         | 0.79                   |
| **Glycerin** | 1.26        | 1.26                   |

>- ✅ These values are typical at room temperature (20°C to 25°C)
>- 🔁 SG can substitute for density (in g/mL) when comparing to water.

🧪 **Example: What is the weight in grams of 15 mL of ethanol?**

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Given volume | 15 mL |
| Density of ethanol | 0.79 g/mL |
| Multiply | 15 × 0.79 = 11.85 g |

🧪 **Example: What volume in mL is 5 g of glycerin?**

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Given mass | 5 g |
| Density of glycerin | 1.26 g/mL |
| Divide | 5 ÷ 1.26 ≈ 3.97 mL |

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- Always check whether the substance is **water** or something else
- If SG is given instead of density, you can treat it as **g/mL** for pharmacy conversions
- Round **only at the final step**
- Clearly label your **units** in all work
