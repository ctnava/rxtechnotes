# Mathematics Concepts Directory

Look at this as more of a quick review resource. It's not comprehensive and doesn't include very deep examples. However as long as you understand these concepts to their core, you'll always come out on top.

> 🚨 Disclaimer: I haven't had a chance to double-check the math. I'm just sort of blowing through it. I'm more worried about covering law & SOPs. I'll come back to this afterwards.
