## 🔑 Key Concepts

Parenteral dosage calculations are used to determine **how much volume to withdraw** from a vial to administer the **correct dose** of medication via IV, IM, or SC injection.

The **manufacturer’s label** provides essential information:

- Drug name and total quantity
- Volume (if liquid)
- Concentration (e.g. mg/mL)
- Instructions for **reconstitution** (if applicable)

### 📦 Reconstitution

**Reconstitution** is the process of adding a specific volume of **diluent** (usually sterile water or saline) to a **powdered medication** to create a **liquid solution or suspension** for administration.

> 🚨 Many injectables and oral suspensions are supplied in **powder form** to improve stability and extend shelf life.

The label will specify:

- Type & volume of **diluent**
- Final **concentration** (e.g. mg/mL)
- **Stability** & storage conditions after reconstitution
  - The product must often be **refrigerated**
  - The **expiration date** changes (often 7–14 days)

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- ✅ Always read the full manufacturer label
- ⚠️ Confirm whether drug is liquid or powder
- 🧪 Use only approved diluents and volumes when reconstituting
- 🛡️ Double-check concentration after reconstitution before dosing
- 📏 Use precise syringes to measure small volumes
- 🧊 Note expiration time post-reconstitution if applicable
