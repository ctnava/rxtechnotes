## 🔎 What is Reconstitution?

🧪 **Reconstitution** refers to the process of adding a specific diluent (liquid) to a powdered drug in order to create a usable liquid solution or suspension for administration. This is a **critical skill** in both sterile and non-sterile compounding.

## 🔑 Why Are Drugs Supplied as Powders?

Many injectable or biologically sensitive medications are unstable in liquid form and can degrade quickly after mixing. Supplying these medications as powders:

- 🛡️ Improves **shelf life** and **stability**
- ☣️ Reduces **degradation** from light, temperature, or moisture
- 🚨 Avoids need for preservatives in sensitive formulations
- 🧪 Allows for **precise concentration control** at time of use

📦 **Common Examples**

| Drug | Reason for Powder Form |
|------|------------------------|
| 💉 **Cefazolin** | Unstable in solution; short shelf life |
| 🧬 **Biologics (e.g. monoclonal antibodies)** | Protein structure sensitive to agitation or heat |
| 💊 **Chemotherapy agents** | Hazardous in liquid form; requires controlled handling |

## 📘 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Powdered Drug** | A solid form of a medication supplied in a vial or container. Not ready for use until reconstituted. |
| **Reconstitution** | The process of dissolving a powder into an appropriate diluent to create a liquid medication. |
| **Diluent** | The liquid (e.g. Sterile Water for Injection, Normal Saline) used to dissolve the powdered drug. |
| **Final Volume** | The total volume of solution after the powder has been fully dissolved in the diluent. |
| **Powder Volume** | The difference between the final volume and the amount of diluent added; represents the volume occupied by the drug itself. |

## 📘 Sources for Reconstitution Instructions

| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| 📦 **Package Insert** | Lists type and amount of diluent, final concentration, and storage info |
| 💉 **Vial Label** | Often includes amount of drug and reconstitution instructions |

🚨 The label typically shows:

- Powdered drug amount (e.g. "1 g cefazolin")
- Diluent volume to add (e.g. "Add 2.5 mL Sterile Water")
- Final volume after reconstitution (e.g. 3.5 mL)

## 🚨 Tips and Best Practices

- 🛡️ **Read vial label and package insert carefully** before preparing.
- 📍 Use a **prescribed diluent only** (e.g. Sterile Water, NS, Bacteriostatic Water).
- ☣️ **Do not shake** protein-based powders (e.g. biologics); swirl gently.
- 🛡️ **Label vial** with date/time of reconstitution and initials.
- 📍 Concentration may vary depending on **volume of diluent added**—follow exact instructions.

## 📘 Calculations

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Powder Volume} = \text{Final Volume} - \text{Diluent Volume}$

💧 **Example: Calculate Powder Volume**

**Label**: Add 9.5 mL diluent to 1 g of cefazolin. Final volume: 10 mL.

$\text{Powder Volume} = 10\ \text{mL} - 9.5\ \text{mL} = \boxed{0.5\ \text{mL}}$

## 📘 Calculating Concentration After Reconstitution

Concentration is typically expressed as **amount per 1 mL**.

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Amount of Drug}}{\text{Final Volume}}$

💧 **Example: Calculate concentration**

**Label**: 1 g cefazolin reconstituted to total volume of 4 mL.

$\text{Concentration} = \frac{1000\ \text{mg}}{4\ \text{mL}} = \boxed{250\ \text{mg/mL}}$

## 📘 Calculating Volume to Deliver Specific Dose

When a drug is reconstituted, calculate the **volume** needed to give the **desired dose** using the concentration.

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Volume to Give} = \frac{\text{Desired Dose}}{\text{Concentration}}$

💧 **Example: Dose Volume Calculation**

**Order**: Give 500 mg of cefazolin. Concentration = 250 mg/mL.

$\text{Volume} = \frac{500\ \text{mg}}{250\ \text{mg/mL}} = \boxed{2\ \text{mL}}$
