# 💉 Powder Drug Volume and Reconstitution Calculations

## 🔎 Why Are Some Medications Supplied as Powders?

📍 Many parenteral drugs are unstable in liquid form and degrade quickly. These medications are supplied as **powdered solids** to ensure stability and shelf life.

Common reasons:

- 🚨 **Short stability** in solution
- ☣️ **Light or temperature sensitivity**
- 🛡️ Preservative-free formulas for sensitive use (e.g. spinal, neonatal)

## 📘 Sources for Reconstitution Instructions

| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| 📦 **Package Insert** | Lists type and amount of diluent, final concentration, and storage info |
| 💉 **Vial Label** | Often includes amount of drug and reconstitution instructions |

🚨 The label typically shows:

- Powdered drug amount (e.g. "1 g cefazolin")
- Diluent volume to add (e.g. "Add 2.5 mL Sterile Water")
- Final volume after reconstitution (e.g. 3.5 mL)

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **Powder volume**: Volume occupied by the drug after reconstitution.
- **Diluent volume**: Volume of liquid added to dissolve the powder.
- **Final volume**: Total volume of solution after drug has dissolved.

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Powder Volume} = \text{Final Volume} - \text{Diluent Volume}$

💧 **Example: Calculate Powder Volume**

**Label**: Add 9.5 mL diluent to 1 g of cefazolin. Final volume: 10 mL.

$\text{Powder Volume} = 10\ \text{mL} - 9.5\ \text{mL} = \boxed{0.5\ \text{mL}}$

## 📘 Calculating Concentration After Reconstitution

Concentration is typically expressed as **amount per 1 mL**.

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Amount of Drug}}{\text{Final Volume}}$

💧 **Example: Calculate concentration**

**Label**: 1 g cefazolin reconstituted to total volume of 4 mL.

$\text{Concentration} = \frac{1000\ \text{mg}}{4\ \text{mL}} = \boxed{250\ \text{mg/mL}}$

## 📘 Calculating Volume to Deliver Specific Dose

When a drug is reconstituted, calculate the **volume** needed to give the **desired dose** using the concentration.

🔢 Formula:

$\text{Volume to Give} = \frac{\text{Desired Dose}}{\text{Concentration}}$

💧 **Example: Dose Volume Calculation**

**Order**: Give 500 mg of cefazolin. Concentration = 250 mg/mL.

$\text{Volume} = \frac{500\ \text{mg}}{250\ \text{mg/mL}} = \boxed{2\ \text{mL}}$

## 🚨 Tips and Best Practices

- 🛡️ **Read vial label and package insert carefully** before preparing.
- 📍 Use a **prescribed diluent only** (e.g. Sterile Water, NS, Bacteriostatic Water).
- ☣️ **Do not shake** protein-based powders (e.g. biologics); swirl gently.
- 🛡️ **Label vial** with date/time of reconstitution and initials.
- 📍 Concentration may vary depending on **volume of diluent added**—follow exact instructions.
