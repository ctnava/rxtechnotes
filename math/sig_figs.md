Understanding **significant figures** is essential in pharmacy and scientific calculations to ensure precision and prevent dosage errors. These rules determine which digits in a number contribute to its measured precision.

## ✅ What Are Significant Figures?

Significant figures are the digits in a number that contribute to its accuracy. This includes all nonzero digits and some zeros, depending on their position.

## 🔑 Rules for Identifying Significant Figures

| Rule # | Description | Example | Sig Figs Count |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Nonzero digits are always significant.** | `123` | 3 |
| 2️⃣ | **Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant.** | `101`, `1.008` | 3, 4 |
| 3️⃣ | **Trailing zeros *after* the decimal are always significant.** | `2.300`, `0.450` | 4, 3 |
| 4️⃣ | **Trailing zeros *before* the decimal in numbers ≥ 10 are significant.** | `150.` | 3 |
| 5️⃣ | **Leading zeros (placeholders) are *never* significant.** | `0.0045`, `0.00001` | 2, 1 |

## 🧪 Example Calculations Involving Significant Figures

### 📏 Multiplication

**Problem:**  

\( 2.34 \times 1.2 = ? \)  

**Step-by-step:**

- \( 2.34 \) has 3 significant figures
- \( 1.2 \) has 2 significant figures

> Answer should have 2 significant figures

**Raw product:**  
\( 2.34 \times 1.2 = 2.808 \)  

**Rounded result:**  

==> \( \boxed{2.8} \) (2 sig figs)

---

### ➗ Division

**Problem:**  

\( 5.67 \div 0.82 = ? \)

**Step-by-step:**

- \( 5.67 \) → 3 sig figs  
- \( 0.82 \) → 2 sig figs  

> Answer should have 2 significant figures

**Raw quotient:**  
\( 5.67 \div 0.82 = 6.9146341 \)

**Rounded result:**  
**→ \( \boxed{6.9} \)** (2 sig figs)

---

### ➕ Addition

**Problem:**  

\( 12.11 + 0.3 = ? \)

**Step-by-step:**  

For addition, match **decimal precision**, not sig fig count:

- \( 12.11 \) → 2 decimal places  
- \( 0.3 \) → 1 decimal place  

> Answer must have 1 decimal place

**Raw sum:**  
\( 12.11 + 0.3 = 12.41 \)

**Rounded result:**  
 \( \boxed{12.4} \)

---

### ➖ Subtraction

**Problem:**

\( 7.456 - 0.32 = ? \)

**Step-by-step:**

- \( 7.456 \) → 3 decimal places  
- \( 0.32 \) → 2 decimal places  
**Answer must have 2 decimal places**

**Raw difference:**  
\( 7.456 - 0.32 = 7.136 \)

**Rounded result:**  
**→ \( \boxed{7.14} \)**

---

## 📌 Quick Tips

- **Multiplication/Division:** Round to the *fewest significant figures*.
- **Addition/Subtraction:** Round to the *least number of decimal places*.

## 🧠 Memorization Tip

> "**Atlantic–Pacific Rule**":  
> If the **decimal point is present** (Pacific), start counting from the **Pacific (left)** side.  
> If the **decimal point is absent** (Atlantic), start from the **Atlantic (right)** side.
