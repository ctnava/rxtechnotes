# Routes & Formulations

The absorption, distribution, and overall effect of a drug in the body depend on both the **route of administration** and the **formulation** used. Drugs are delivered in specific units called **dosage forms**, each tailored to optimize efficacy, stability, and patient compliance.

## 🛤️ Routes of Administration

Routes of administration are classified into two broad categories:

- **Enteral**: Administration involving the **alimentary canal**, including:
  - Oral (PO)
  - Sublingual (SL)
  - Buccal
  - Rectal (PR)
  
- **Parenteral**: Administration **bypassing** the gastrointestinal tract, including:
  - Intravenous (IV)
  - Intramuscular (IM)
  - Subcutaneous (SC)
  - Intradermal (ID)
  - Other specialized routes (e.g., intra-articular, intrathecal)

> 📌 Each route affects **onset**, **bioavailability**, and **duration of action**.

## 💊 Dosage Forms

A **dosage form** refers to the physical form of a drug product suitable for administration. A single drug may be available in multiple dosage forms, each designed to modify how the drug is delivered and absorbed. Selection depends on patient needs, target effect location, and pharmacokinetics.

🔑 **Local vs Systemic Effects**

- **Local Effect**: Drug activity is limited to the site of application (e.g., topical cream).
- **Systemic Effect**: Drug enters systemic circulation and acts at distant sites (e.g., oral tablet, IV injection).

### 🧪 Composition of Dosage Forms

Dosage forms consist of:

- **Active Ingredient**: The pharmacologically active compound.
- **Inactive Ingredients** (Excipients): Substances included to aid manufacturing, stability, delivery, or absorption.

| Excipient Type | Purpose | Common Dosage Forms |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Binders** | Hold ingredients together in a cohesive unit | Tablets |
| **Lubricants** | Prevent sticking to manufacturing equipment | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Disintegrants** | Promote breakup of the dosage form after intake  | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Diluents** | Add bulk to formulations for proper dosing | Tablets, Capsules, Powders |
| **Preservatives** | Prevent microbial growth | Liquids, Ophthalmics, Topicals |
| **Flavoring Agents** | Improve palatability | Oral Liquids, Chewable Tablets |
| **Colorants** | Aid in product identification | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Solvents** | Dissolve active ingredients | Solutions, Injectables |
| **Coating Agents** | Mask taste or control release | Enteric-coated, Extended-release tabs|

📍 *Note: Not all excipients are inert for all patients. Some may cause allergies or intolerances.*

## 👄 Oral Formulations

Per os (`PO`), Latin for "by mouth", is the most frequently used route of drug administration.

Drugs administered orally pass through the stomach, which has a very **acidic pH (1–2)**. Some drugs **cannot** be administered orally because they are **degraded or inactivated** by gastric acid or enzymes.

> 📍 **Food Intake Warning**: The presence of food can **delay, reduce, or enhance** drug absorption depending on the formulation and the drug's properties.

### 💊 Oral Solid Formulations

Solid dosage forms must typically undergo two processes:

- **Disintegration**: Breaking apart into smaller particles
- **Dissolution**: Dissolving into solution for absorption

Only dissolved drug molecules can cross gastrointestinal membranes and enter systemic circulation.

#### 🔄 Modified Release Formulations

**Modified-release** formulations alter the timing and/or location of drug release. These reduce dosing frequency and may offer steadier blood concentrations.

Common terms include:

| Abbreviation | Meaning              |
|--------------|----------------------|
| SR           | Sustained Release     |
| SA           | Sustained Action      |
| ER / XR      | Extended Release      |
| PA           | Prolonged Action      |
| CR           | Controlled Release    |
| TR           | Time Release          |
| LA           | Long Acting           |

> 🛡️ **Do NOT crush, split, or chew** modified-release, layered, or coated formulations unless specifically labeled as safe to do so.

#### ⚪ Tablets

**Tablets** are hard, compressed formulations made by pressing active and inactive ingredients into a solid shape. Common types include:

- **Film or sugar-coated tablets**: For taste masking or protection
- **Scored tablets**: Designed to be safely split
- **Multiple-compressed tablets**: Two-layer or compression-coated, often for combination or staged release
- **Repeated action tablets**: Release a portion of the dose immediately, followed by another later
- **Chewable tablets**: Intended to be chewed before swallowing
- **Effervescent tablets**: Dissolved in water before ingestion

> 🚨 **Enteric-coated tablets** resist stomach acid and disintegrate only at the higher pH of the **small intestine**.  
> 🛡️ **Do not cut or crush** enteric-coated, layered, or time-release tablets.

#### 💊 Capsules

**Capsules** are solid dosage forms in which drugs and excipients are enclosed in a **gelatin shell**.

Key features:

- **Hard gelatin capsules**: Usually contain powder or pellets (small tablets)
- **Softgels**: Contain **predissolved drugs in a liquid base**
- **Gelatin dissolves**, releasing the contents, which must then dissolve into solution for absorption

> 📍 Capsule size depends on the volume of contents. Smaller numbers indicate **larger** capsule sizes (i.e. 000 to 5).

#### 📨 Bulk Powders

**Bulk powders** are loose powder forms packaged in folded paper or foil pouches. They contain:

- The active drug
- Optional excipients that aid dissolution or flavor

Usage:

- Poured onto the back of the tongue and swallowed
- Or dissolved in water or a flavored beverage before ingestion

> 📍 Bulk powders bypass the **disintegration** step and dissolve directly, potentially leading to **faster onset** than tablets or capsules.

### 🥤 Oral Liquid Formulations

Oral **liquid formulations** deliver the drug in a pre-dissolved or suspended form, bypassing the need for **disintegration** and, in some cases, **dissolution**. This generally leads to **faster absorption** compared to solid oral dosage forms.

#### 💧 Solutions

**Solutions** are homogeneous mixtures in which one or more substances (**solutes**) are completely dissolved in a **solvent**. They are **clear** (not necessarily colorless) and contain no undissolved particles.

Types of oral solutions:

- **Aqueous solutions**: Water is the solvent. Most common type.
  - **Syrups**:
    - Aqueous solutions saturated with **sucrose** or other sugars
    - Viscous, sweet, and flavored
    - Contain **<10% alcohol**
  - **Elixirs**:
    - Clear, sweetened **hydroalcoholic** solutions
    - Used for alcohol or water-soluble drugs
    - Less viscous and less sweet than syrups
    - Alcohol content ranges from **5–40%**

- **Nonaqueous solutions**: Solvent is primarily **not water**. Only a limited number of nonaqueous solvents are allowed due to toxicity concerns (e.g. Glycerine, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol).

- **Spirits / Essences**:
  - Alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of **volatile substances** (e.g., essential oils)
  - Alcohol content: **62–85%**
  - Used for flavoring or mild medicinal effects

- **Tinctures**:
  - Alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of **nonvolatile substances**
  - **10% drug strength** for potent drugs
  - **20% drug strength** for non-potent drugs

📌 **Considerations**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Homogeneous doses | Shorter shelf life (less chemically stable) |
| Faster absorption | Poor taste may require masking |
| Suitable for patients unable to swallow solids | Bulky and heavy to store/transport |
| Easy to adjust doses | May require dosing tools (oral syringes, cups) |
|  | Some drugs are not soluble in acceptable solvents |

#### 🌫️ Suspensions

**Suspensions** are **heterogeneous** mixtures in which the drug is suspended as fine particles in a liquid. The drug **does not dissolve** completely.

- 🛡️ Must be **shaken well** before each dose to ensure uniformity
- Flavored and sweetened to improve palatability

**Reconstitution**:

- Many suspensions are sold as **lyophilized powders** (freeze-dried)
- Require **reconstitution** with water before use
- Common in pediatric antibiotics

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Allows administration of **insoluble drugs** | Particles **settle over time** |
| Chemically **more stable** than in solution | Texture may be gritty or unpleasant |
| Masks taste |  |
| Suitable for patients who can't take solids |  |

#### Colloidal Dispersions

Colloids are mixtures where **small particles** (1–1000 nanometers) are dispersed throughout a medium. They are intermediate between solutions and suspensions.

##### 🧴 Emulsions

**Emulsions** are **liquid–liquid** dispersions of two immiscible phases (usually oleaginous (oil) and aqueous). One phase is dispersed into the other as **droplets**, stabilized by an **emulsifying agent**.

- **Oil-in-Water (o/w)**: Water is continuous phase; oil is dispersed
- **Water-in-Oil (w/o)**: Oil is continuous phase; water is dispersed

Notes:

- Emulsions for oral use are rare due to **instability** and **oily texture**
- Used when oral solubility or bioavailability of a drug are greatly increased or for better flavoring agents
- Common in **topical** dosage forms
- **Creaming**: droplets rise/fall but can be **re-dispersed** by shaking
- **Coalescence**: irreversible merging of droplets (product failure)

> 🛡️ Must be shaken well before each use. Visually inspect for separation.

##### 🌿 Gels

**Gels** are **semi-solid** systems where a **liquid phase is dispersed within a solid matrix** formed by gelling agents. They are sometimes used orally, though more common topically.

Key characteristics:

- Require **12–24 hours** to reach full viscosity and clarity
- Sometimes easier to incorporate the drug **before gel formation**
- **Agent Concentration**: 0.5% – 10%
- Gelling agents used orally:
  - **Carbomers**
  - **Methylcellulose**
  - **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)**
  - **Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC)**

> 📍 Avoid using gelling agents not labeled for oral use. Some are only appropriate for topical or ophthalmic formulations.
