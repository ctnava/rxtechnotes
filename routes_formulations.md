# Routes & Formulations

The absorption, distribution, and overall effect of a drug in the body depend on both the **route of administration** and the **formulation** used. Drugs are delivered in specific units called **dosage forms**, each tailored to optimize efficacy, stability, and patient compliance.

## 🛤️ Routes of Administration

Routes of administration are classified into two broad categories:

- **Enteral**: Administration involving the **alimentary canal**
  - 🔗 See [Formulations & Dosage Forms](./ref/formulations/enteral_routes.md)
- **Parenteral**: Administration **bypassing** the gastrointestinal tract
  - 🔗 See [Formulations & Dosage Forms](./ref/formulations/parenteral_routes.md)

> 📌 Each route affects **onset**, **bioavailability**, and **duration of action**.

## 💊 Dosage Forms

A **dosage form** refers to the physical form of a drug product suitable for administration. A single drug may be available in multiple dosage forms, each designed to modify how the drug is delivered and absorbed. Selection depends on patient needs, target effect location, and pharmacokinetics.

🔑 **Local vs Systemic Effects**

- **Local Effect**: Drug activity is limited to the site of application (e.g., topical cream).
- **Systemic Effect**: Drug enters systemic circulation and acts at distant sites (e.g., oral tablet, IV injection).

### 🧪 Composition of Dosage Forms

Dosage forms consist of:

- **Active Ingredient**: The pharmacologically active compound.
- **Inactive Ingredients** (Excipients): Substances included to aid manufacturing, stability, delivery, or absorption.

| Excipient Type | Purpose | Common Dosage Forms |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Binders** | Hold ingredients together in a cohesive unit | Tablets |
| **Lubricants** | Prevent sticking to manufacturing equipment | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Disintegrants** | Promote breakup of the dosage form after intake  | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Diluents** | Add bulk to formulations for proper dosing | Tablets, Capsules, Lyophilized Powders |
| **Preservatives** | Prevent microbial growth | Liquids, Ophthalmics, Topicals |
| **Flavoring Agents** | Improve palatability | Oral Liquids, Chewable Tablets |
| **Colorants** | Aid in product identification | Tablets, Capsules |
| **Solvents** | Dissolve active ingredients | Solutions, Injectables |
| **Coating Agents** | Mask taste or control release | Enteric-coated, Extended-release tabs|

📍 *Note: Not all excipients are inert for all patients. Some may cause allergies or intolerances.*
