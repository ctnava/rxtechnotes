- 📝 Handwritten forms (often for controlled substances)  
- 📠 Faxed prescriptions  
- ☎️ Verbal orders (received directly by the pharmacist)  
- 🧾 E-scripts through HIPAA-compliant Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

> 📠 For accuracy and improved record keeping, many pharmacies scan the prescription into the pharmacy dispensing system.

Refills can be requested:

- 📱 Via smartphone apps  
- 💻 Through pharmacy websites  
- 🤝 In person  
- ☎️ Over the phone

> 📋 For verbal orders: the pharmacist takes the call and transcribes the prescription; technicians then input the data into the system

##### 🧾 Collecting & Entering Patient Profile Information

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for:

- Recording accurate **demographic details**
- Entering or updating **insurance information**

##### 📦 Storage Area

📦 **Inventory Ordering**

Pharmacy technicians help ensure the pharmacy is well-stocked without over-ordering.

- Be familiar with **high-demand medications** (e.g., common antihypertensives) and ensure adequate inventory
- **Low-demand items** do not require large quantities and may be special ordered when needed
- Many pharmacies use **automated inventory systems**, but technicians may manually place orders for out-of-stock or special items
- Communicate **shortages or backorders** to the pharmacist or supervisor

> 🔄 Restocking should be proactive—anticipate needs based on trends and upcoming holidays or flu season.
