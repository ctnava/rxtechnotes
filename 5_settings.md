### Community Pharmacy Layout & Duties

#### 🧾 Front-End

##### 📞 Picking up the Phone

**Retail technicians are the first point of contact for most patients**. Professional demeanor, clear communication, and operational efficiency are critical for ensuring medication safety and customer satisfaction.

- Confirm understanding by repeating concerns  
- Use a respectful, positive tone  
- Refer to patients by name when possible  
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone

> ✅ Use at least two patient identifiers to confirm their identity.
> 💌 Some large pharmacies send text messages to patients to communicate updates on prescriptions and their status. This information may also be available through their official smartphone apps.

##### 💻 Processing Prescriptions

⚠️ ALWAYS for allergies, medications the patient is taking, & if there were any changes to insurance.

New prescriptions may be submitted by:

- 📝 Handwritten forms (often for controlled substances)  
- 📠 Faxed prescriptions  
- ☎️ Verbal orders (received directly by the pharmacist)  
- 🧾 E-scripts through HIPAA-compliant Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

> 📠 For accuracy and improved record keeping, many pharmacies scan the prescription into the pharmacy dispensing system.

Refills can be requested:

- 📱 Via smartphone apps  
- 💻 Through pharmacy websites  
- 🤝 In person  
- ☎️ Over the phone

> 📋 For verbal orders: the pharmacist takes the call and transcribes the prescription; technicians then input the data into the system

##### 🧾 Collecting & Entering Patient Profile Information

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for:

- Recording accurate **demographic details**
- Entering or updating **insurance information**
- Verifying information for prescription processing and billing
- Confirming **prescriber details** and known allergies

<!-- ##### 🔔 Ringing Up Prescriptions

When a patient arrives to pick up a prescription, this is the final opportunity to verify information, ensure legal compliance, and offer pharmacist counseling.

1. 📋 Begin by asking:
   - Patient’s **last name and date of birth** to pull up their profile
   - Retrieve the correct prescription bag from the **alphabetized pickup shelf**
   - Confirm the patient's **address and phone number** (if on file)
   - ⚠️ For **Controlled Substances**:
     - Request and **verify the patient's ID** (check state/federal ID laws)
     - May be required to log ID info depending on drug and local regulation
2. 💬 Ask final screening questions (especially for new or changed therapies):
   - “Have you started taking any new vitamins or supplements?”
   - “Any new allergies?”
   - “Have you filled prescriptions at another pharmacy recently?”
   - “Would you like to receive a flu or other vaccine today?”
3. 💵 Copay & Payment:
   - Inform the patient of their **copay** amount (have a calculator handy)
   - If it’s a **partial fill**, do **not** collect copay until the remainder is dispensed
   - Accept payment (cash, credit, or other methods)
4. ✍️ Have the patient **sign the pickup log**
     - Used for insurance reimbursement
     - Reviewed during pharmacy audits
     - 🧑‍⚕️ Offer to have the **pharmacist counsel** the patient, especially for new medications, changes in therapy, or if the patient appears confused. Make sure to document the outcome!

📦 **Inventory Ordering**

Pharmacy technicians help ensure the pharmacy is well-stocked without over-ordering.

- Be familiar with **high-demand medications** (e.g., common antihypertensives) and ensure adequate inventory
- **Low-demand items** do not require large quantities and may be special ordered when needed
- Many pharmacies use **automated inventory systems**, but technicians may manually place orders for out-of-stock or special items
- Communicate **shortages or backorders** to the pharmacist or supervisor

> 🔄 Restocking should be proactive—anticipate needs based on trends and upcoming holidays or flu season.
