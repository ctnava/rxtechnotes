# Chapter 5: Pharmacy Settings & Technician Specializations

## 🏪 Community Pharmacies

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

- 🧾 **Independent Pharmacies**: Individually owned and operated, often serving local communities with personalized service.
- 🏬 **Chain Pharmacies**: National or regional pharmacy chains such as CVS or Walgreens.
- 🛒 **Mass Merchandiser Pharmacies**: Large retail chains like Walmart, Target, or Costco that have in-store pharmacies.
- 🥕 **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

Strong communication skills are essential in community pharmacy settings because pharmacy technicians working here are the most exposed to patients.

✅ Best practices:

- Listen actively and make eye contact  
- Confirm understanding by repeating concerns  
- Use a respectful, positive tone  
- Refer to patients by name when possible  
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone  
- Always follow facility policies and procedures  
- Refer all clinical questions to the pharmacist

🏥 **Walk-In Clinics**

Some pharmacy locations operate on-site clinics (e.g. CVS MinuteClinic or Walgreens Healthcare Clinic) staffed by:

- 👩‍⚕️ Nurse Practitioners (NPs)
- 🧑‍⚕️ Physician Assistants (PAs)

These clinics offer minor acute care services such as:

- Treatment for infections (e.g., strep throat, UTI)  
- Injury care (e.g., sprains, cuts)  
- Health screenings (e.g., blood pressure, glucose)  
- Routine immunizations (e.g., flu shots)

Pharmacy technicians may assist with:

- Patient intake and registration  
- Electronic health record (EHR) entry  
- Coordinating follow-up or referrals

### Community Pharmacy Layout & Duties
