# Chapter 5: Pharmacy Settings & Technician Specializations

A pharmacy technician is an individual who, under the direct supervision and control of a pharmacist, performs non-discretionary tasks.

The title **"pharmacy technician"** is used in 47 states, though some states use different terms:

- 🏔️ **Unlicensed Personnel** – Colorado  
- 🏛️ **Ancillary Personnel** – District of Columbia  
- 🌾 **Pharmaceutical Technicians** – North Dakota  
- 🐴 **Registered Pharmacy Technician** – Wyoming  
- 🌰 **Qualified Pharmacy Technician** – Ohio

Pharmacy technicians exist to **free up the pharmacist’s time** for more clinical duties by taking on routine technical tasks. To meet the growing demands of pharmacy services, technician roles are being expanded to include **advanced and specialized functions**, often with **higher pay and training requirements**.

> ⚖️ In **California**, pharmacists may supervise **up to two** technicians. However, if only **one pharmacist** is on duty, the ratio must be **1:1**. Limits vary from state to state.

🔬 **Scope of Practice**

The scope varies from state to state but generally includes:

- 🏥 Assisting the pharmacist in labeling and filling prescriptions (in both **inpatient** and **outpatient** settings)  
- 📦 Helping patients drop off and pick up prescriptions  
- 🖥️ Entering prescription and insurance information into pharmacy systems  
- 🧪 Compounding oral solutions, ointments, creams, and sterile IV medications  
- 💊 Prepackaging bulk medications into unit doses  
- 🛒 Assisting with medication purchasing, billing, and inventory control  
- 📞 Working with insurers to process claims and request refills  

> 🎖️ Pharmacy technicians in the armed services may dispense medications under the supervision of pharmacists.

🛑 **Limitations**

Technicians are not allowed to:

- ❌ Override computer alerts without notifying the pharmacist  
- ❌ Transfer prescriptions between pharmacies  
- ❌ Receive new verbal prescriptions from prescribers  
- ❌ Act as the final authority on verifying dosage or directions  
- ❌ Provide patient counseling (this is strictly a pharmacist role)

## 🚀 Career

### Basic Requirements

Pharmacy Technicians must be licensed and registered in most states. Licensure allows them to perform pharmacy tasks under pharmacist supervision and ensures adherence to local laws. **Requirements are state-specific**, but commonly include:

- Completion of a state-approved training program
- Passing a national exam (PTCE or ExCPT)
- Background checks and drug screening
- Application through the **State Board of Pharmacy**

California State Licensure Requirements:

- **Proof of Education**: transcript or notarized copy of diploma OR GED / HiSET/ TASC + CHSPE
- **Proof of Training**: affidavit of ASHP-accredited coursework, associates degree in Pharmacy Technology, or graduation from a ACPE-accredited school of pharmacy
- **Supporting Documents (optional; skips training)**: PTCB Certification or DD-214
- **CE Requirements**: 20 hours every 2 years, including **1 hour in cultural competency**
- **Renewals**: Notices mailed 90 days before expiration; licenses are canceled if not renewed within 90 days post-expiration
- **License Portability**: California has **no reciprocity**; technicians moving to other states must reapply there. Returning to CA may require full reapplication if the license was canceled

### Advancement

A **Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT)** is credentialed by organizations such as the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB)*** or ***National Healthcareer Association (NHA)***. Certification demonstrates advanced competency and may qualify technicians for expanded duties, such as medication reconciliation or billing.

- **Benefits**: National recognition, greater job opportunities, higher wages, enhanced credibility
- **Exams**: Must pass either the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE)*** (by the PTCB) or ***Examination for Certified Pharmacy Technicians (ExCPT)*** (by the NHA)
- **Recertification**: Every 2 years, requiring 20 hours of ASHP-accredited **Continuing Education (CE)**, including:
