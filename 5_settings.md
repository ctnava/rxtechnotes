📦 **Inventory Ordering**

Pharmacy technicians help ensure the pharmacy is well-stocked without over-ordering.

- Be familiar with **high-demand medications** (e.g., common antihypertensives) and ensure adequate inventory
- **Low-demand items** do not require large quantities and may be special ordered when needed
- Many pharmacies use **automated inventory systems**, but technicians may manually place orders for out-of-stock or special items
- Communicate **shortages or backorders** to the pharmacist or supervisor

> 🔄 Restocking should be proactive—anticipate needs based on trends and upcoming holidays or flu season.
