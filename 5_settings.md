# Chapter 5: Pharmacy Settings & Technician Specializations

A pharmacy technician is an individual who, under the direct supervision and control of a pharmacist, performs non-discretionary tasks.

The title **"pharmacy technician"** is used in 47 states, though some states use different terms:

- 🏔️ **Unlicensed Personnel** – Colorado  
- 🏛️ **Ancillary Personnel** – District of Columbia  
- 🌾 **Pharmaceutical Technicians** – North Dakota  
- 🐴 **Registered Pharmacy Technician** – Wyoming  
- 🌰 **Qualified Pharmacy Technician** – Ohio

Pharmacy technicians exist to **free up the pharmacist’s time** for more clinical duties by taking on routine technical tasks. To meet the growing demands of pharmacy services, technician roles are being expanded to include **advanced and specialized functions**, often with **higher pay and training requirements**.

> ⚖️ In **California**, pharmacists may supervise **up to two** technicians. However, if only **one pharmacist** is on duty, the ratio must be **1:1**. Limits vary from state to state.

🔬 **Scope of Practice**

The scope varies from state to state but generally includes:

- 🏥 Assisting the pharmacist in labeling and filling prescriptions (in both **inpatient** and **outpatient** settings)  
- 📦 Helping patients drop off and pick up prescriptions  
- 🖥️ Entering prescription and insurance information into pharmacy systems  
- 🧪 Compounding oral solutions, ointments, creams, and sterile IV medications  
- 💊 Prepackaging bulk medications into unit doses  
- 🛒 Assisting with medication purchasing, billing, and inventory control  
- 📞 Working with insurers to process claims and request refills  

> 🎖️ Pharmacy technicians in the armed services may dispense medications under the supervision of pharmacists.

🛑 **Limitations**

Technicians are not allowed to:

- ❌ Override computer alerts without notifying the pharmacist  
- ❌ Transfer prescriptions between pharmacies  
- ❌ Receive new verbal prescriptions from prescribers  
- ❌ Act as the final authority on verifying dosage or directions

## 🚀 Career

- Completion of a state-approved training program

### Advancement

A **Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT)** is credentialed by organizations such as the ***Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB)*** or ***National Healthcareer Association (NHA)***. Certification demonstrates advanced competency and may qualify technicians for expanded duties, such as medication reconciliation or billing.

## 🏪 Community Pharmacies

Community (or retail) pharmacy practice involves providing prescription and healthcare services directly to the public. Nearly two-thirds of all prescription medications are dispensed through community pharmacies, requiring a substantial portion of the nation's pharmacists and technicians to meet public demand.

- 🧾 **Independent Pharmacies**: Individually owned and operated, often serving local communities with personalized service.
- 🏬 **Chain Pharmacies**: National or regional pharmacy chains such as CVS or Walgreens.
- 🛒 **Mass Merchandiser Pharmacies**: Large retail chains like Walmart, Target, or Costco that have in-store pharmacies.
- 🥕 **Food Store Pharmacies**: Grocery chains such as Publix or Wegmans that include pharmacy departments.

Strong communication skills are essential in community pharmacy settings because pharmacy technicians working here are the most exposed to patients.
