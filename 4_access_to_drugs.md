# Chapter 4: Legal Access to Marketed Drugs

<!-- This chapter covers how patients are authorized access to medications by prescribing authorities.

## Designations

The Durham-Humphrey Amendment amendment established two classes of drugs: *legend* & *over-the-counter* (OTC).

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
- **Legend**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription" or "RX Only".
- **Over-the-Counter(OTC)**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use.
  - **Exempt Narcotics** are medications that contain habit forming ingredients that can be sold by a pharmacist without prescriptions to persons 18 years or older (e.g. cough syrups with small amounts of codeine)
  - **Emergency Contraceptives** (e.g. Plan B One-Step) sometimes have dual marketing, with unique status as OTC & legend drugs at the same time. Depending on the state, a pharmacist may prescribe these on the spot to dispense to patients. 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hidden Dangers of OTC Drugs

**Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are not inherently safe** just because they don‚Äôt require a prescription. Many OTC medications can cause significant drug interactions, adverse effects, or even life-threatening complications; especially when combined with prescription drugs or taken incorrectly. [Here](./medications/otc_analgesics.md) are some considerations for OTC analgesics.

When performing **medication reconciliation** (the process of gathering a patient‚Äôs full medication history), pharmacy technicians must:

- **Ask about all OTC medications**, supplements, and herbal products
- **Document** them in the patient‚Äôs profile
- **Refer patients to the pharmacist** for counseling if any concerns arise

## üîí Controlled & Monitored Substances

The ***Controlled Substances Act (CSA, 1970)*** classifies five levels of controlled substances that have potential for abuse and therefore restricts their distribution. These five categories are called "schedules" and are determined based on potential for abuse, medical use, and risk to overall safety. Drugs placed in Schedules I‚ÄìV are controlled substances and are subject to varying degrees of regulation regarding prescribing, dispensing, and recordkeeping.

The ***Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA, 2005)*** was enacted to combat the illegal production of methamphetamine by creating a list of monitored drugs, equipment, and chemicals while also placing ***strict, time based controls on over-the-counter (OTC)*** sales of ingredients that are commonly found in cold and allergy medications but can also be used in the **illicit manufacture of methamphetamine**.

## Medication Orders & Prescriptions

<!-- Prescriptions and medication orders are instructions from a medical practictioner that authorizes the issue of a drug or device to a patient. -->

<!-- ### Intake & Entry

When processing prescriptions for intake and order entry, make sure they contain the following information:

- **Prescriber Information**: the name, title, office address, and telephone number
- **National Provider Identifier (NPI)**: A prescriber's unique national identification number, mandated by HIPAA and administered by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)
- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: A number assigned to the prescriber by the DEA that is required on all controlled substance prescriptions ([how to verify](./math/i_dea_numbers.md))
- **Date**: when the prescription was written
- **Patient Identifiers**: information used to identify the patient
  - **required**: name & address
  - **optional**: date of birth & weight (for pediatrics)
- **Inscription**: specifies the generic name of the medication, brand name (if required), including strength & amount
- **Signa**: directions for use (notes on translation [here](./ref/sig_translation.md))
- **Refill Instructions**: How many refills are authorized for the patient
- **Product Selection Code (Optional)**: Whether or not the medication is specified to be dispensed as written ([Reference Table](./ref/product_selection.md))
- **Prescriber Signature**: required on all prescriptions

‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS for allergies, medications the patient is taking, & if there were any changes to insurance.

If the prescription or order is for a controlled substance, technicians must verify the DEA number (typically automatic) and calculate the Days Supply for billing purposes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always consult with the pharmacist for DUR alerts!

#### üß© Partial Fills -->

### üß© Partial Fills

A **partial fill** occurs when the pharmacy cannot dispense the full prescribed quantity of a medication, typically due to **insufficient inventory**. In these cases, the pharmacy dispenses a **smaller quantity** temporarily while awaiting restock. For example, a prescription is written for a **90-day supply**, but the pharmacy only has **52 days‚Äô worth** in stock. Instead of turning the patient away, the pharmacy may dispense a **partial fill** (such as a **5-day supply**) to ensure the patient has enough medication and availability of partial fills for other patients until the rest arrives.

> ‚öñÔ∏è **Best Practice**: Dispense only what is needed to bridge the gap until the full quantity becomes available. Avoid dispensing the entire remaining stock unless appropriate for the situation.

**Copays should NOT be collected** until the remainder of the prescription has been filled and picked up by the patient.

- Collect the full copay **only after** the entire prescribed quantity has been dispensed.
- This avoids overcharging the patient for an incomplete fill.

##### üóìÔ∏è Follow-Up

- **Notify** the patient when the remainder is available.
- **Document** the partial fill in the pharmacy system.
- Ensure the final quantity **matches the total prescribed amount**.

##### üîí Schedule II Controlled Substances

**Schedule II** drugs (e.g., oxycodone, morphine, Adderall) have strict federal and state regulations. Partial fills for these medications are allowed in limited circumstances under the **Controlled Substances Act** (21 U.S.C. ¬ß 829) and **DEA Final Rule (2016)**.

Partial fills for Schedule II prescriptions are permitted under the following conditions:

1. **Pharmacy Has Insufficient Stock**
   - If the **pharmacy is out of stock**, a partial fill may be dispensed.
   - The **remaining quantity must be filled within 72 hours**.
   - If the remainder cannot be filled within 72 hours, the pharmacist must:
     - **Notify the prescriber**, and
     - **Void** the remainder of the prescription.
   - A new prescription is required for any remaining quantity after 72 hours.

2. **Patient or Prescriber Request (Including LTCF and Terminal Illness)**
   - Under the **Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)** and DEA Final Rule, partial fills are allowed **at the patient or prescriber‚Äôs request**.
   - The remainder must be filled within **30 days** of the prescription date.
   - Applies to:
     - Standard patients (if requested)
     - **Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF)** residents
     - **Terminally ill** patients

> üß† Must document "terminally ill" or "LTCF patient" on the prescription record.

Each partial fill must be **recorded in the pharmacy system**, including:

- Quantity dispensed
- Date of each fill
- Remaining balance
- Pharmacist initials

<!-- ### üîÑ Refills & Renewal Requests

Each prescription is assigned a **prescription number**, which stays the same for all refills. The number of authorized refills is written by the prescriber and usually printed on the **prescription label**. If a doctor authorizes multiple refills (often written as ‚ÄòRefills: 3‚Äô or ‚ÄòRefills: PRN‚Äô), they are valid for **up to 1 year** from the date the prescription was written, **except for controlled substances**, which have stricter limits.

Refills can be requested:

- üì± Via smartphone apps  
- üíª Through pharmacy websites  
- ü§ù In person  
- ‚òéÔ∏è Over the phone

When a prescription has no refills or is expired, the technician is requesting a new prescription, not a ‚Äòrefill‚Äô in the legal sense. **Pharmacy technicians** may be authorized to contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription ([SOP](./sop/refill_request.md)). -->

#### Inpatient Care

Medication orders in hospital settings have additional requirements:

- **Additional Patient Identifiers**: Hospital ID & Room/ Bed Location
- **Indication for Use**: symptoms

Once the technician has a positive ID on the patient, they will compare the order to the patient's profile to look for duplications or other errors and alert the pharmacist in the event one is found. If all is good, the medication is entered.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always ask for clarification. Assumptions kill.

<!-- #### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Assessing Authenticity

Technicians should screen prescriptions for anything unusual like excessive quantity or signs of forgery.

##### Forgery

Prescription forgery often takes the following forms:

- **Tampering**: Erasure & overwriting of the original prescription by altering the strength or dispensing quantity
- **Theft**: Theft of preprinted prescription pads that may result in legitimate-looking prescriptions 

##### Verifying DEA Numbers

A DEA number is a unique identifier assigned by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to healthcare providers who are authorized to prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances. It is assigned when an individual practitioner, pharmacy, hospital/ clinic, or teaching institution files Form 224 with the DEA.

Pharmacy technicians may be required to help verify DEA numbers as part of prescription validation, especially for controlled substances (Schedules II‚ÄìV) ([How to Verify](./math/i_dea_numbers.md)).-->

<!-- #### üì± Calculating Days Supply

The Days Supply refers to how long a prescription will last based on the quantity dispensed and the prescribed dosing instructions. The formula to calculate Days Supply is `Days¬†Supply = Quantity Dispensed/ Daily Allowance of Medication` and varies slightly based on billable quantity due to dosage form. In the event that the days supply is not a whole number, round down to the nearest whole number ([How to Calculate](./math/days_supply.md)). -->

<!--#### Translating the Signa

The signa (the "sig") is almost always heavily abbreviated and pharmacy techs are often required to transcribe them for computer entry ([Reference Table](./medications/ref.md)). It is important to make sure to do this accurately as this directly affects calculations for days supply. Transcription errors during this phase can lead to potentially fatal administration errors.

At a minimum, these sigs require the following to be considered complete:

- Verb
- Dosage Amount
- Dosage Form
- Route of Administration
  - Site of Administration (for hospitals)
- Frequency
- Timing

example:
`‚Ñû i tab po bid pc #XXX`
`Take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day after meals (Quantity 30)`

 ### Prescription Transfers

Prescriptions may be transferred to another pharmacy at the request of a patient. State laws vary when it comes to different classes of drugs. Technicians may pull up the relevant records for transfer, however the pharmacist is responsible for the actual act of sending or receiving prescriptions.

Protocol:

1. Patient calls the pharmacy that will receive a prescription to request transfer
2. Technician collects the name and contact information of, both, the patient and pharmacy that has the prescription
3. Technician delivers the information to the pharmacist that calls the other pharmacy to initiate transfer -->
