# 📘 Translating the Signa

The signa (the "sig") can be best described as `instructions for use` is almost always heavily abbreviated and pharmacy techs are often required to transcribe them for computer entry.

> ⚠️ **Errors in sig translation can cause incorrect dosing or days supply. Confirm unclear abbreviations with a pharmacist.**

## ✅ Required Elements in Sig

- Action Verb (e.g. Take, Apply, Inject)
- Dose and Dosage Form
- Route of Administration
  - Site of Administration (for hospitals)
- Frequency & Duration of Use
- Timing (e.g., with meals, at bedtime)

**Example**:  
`℞ i tab po bid pc #30` →  
`Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily after meals`

## Common Verbs & Associated Dosage Forms by Route

Directions for use must be specific as the patient does not know what to do with strange medications. Some dosage forms are more toxic when taken the wrong way (e.g. Sulfanilimide).
