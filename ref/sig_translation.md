# 📘 Translating the Signa

The signa (the "sig") is almost always heavily abbreviated and pharmacy techs are often required to transcribe them for computer entry. It is important to make sure to do this accurately as this directly affects calculations for days supply. Transcription errors during this phase can lead to potentially fatal administration errors.

At a minimum, these sigs require the following to be considered complete:

- Verb
- Dosage Amount
- Dosage Form
- Route of Administration
  - Site of Administration (for hospitals)
- Frequency
- Timing

example:
`℞ i tab po bid pc #XXX`
`Take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day after meals (Quantity 30)`

## Common Verbs & Associated Dosage Forms by Route

Directions for use must be specific as the patient does not know what to do with strange medications. Some dosage forms are more toxic when taken the wrong way (e.g. Sulfanilimide).

| Verb | Route | Dosage Form |
|-------------|-------|-------|
