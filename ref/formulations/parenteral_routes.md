🔑 Used when:

- Oral absorption is poor or unreliable
- The drug is degraded by the GI tract
- A **rapid or controlled** response is needed
- The patient is **unconscious, uncooperative, vomiting**, or **unable to swallow**

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- **Higher cost** due to sterile preparation and storage
- **Requires trained personnel** to administer (especially for IV, IM)
- **Difficult to reverse** in case of adverse or toxic reactions
- Risk of **infection, phlebitis, infiltration, or nerve injury**

> 🛡️ Must be **sterile** and **pyrogen-free**; preservatives and tonicity agents may be used.
