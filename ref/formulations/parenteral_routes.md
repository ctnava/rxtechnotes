# Parenteral Routes of Administration

**Parenteral administration** involves delivering drugs while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

🔑 Used when:

- Oral absorption is poor or unreliable
- The drug is degraded by the GI tract
- A **rapid or controlled** response is needed
- The patient is **unconscious, uncooperative, vomiting**, or **unable to swallow**

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- **Higher cost** due to sterile preparation and storage
- **Requires trained personnel** to administer (especially for IV, IM)
- **Difficult to reverse** in case of adverse or toxic reactions
- Risk of **infection, phlebitis, infiltration, or nerve injury**

> 🛡️ Must be **sterile** and **pyrogen-free**; preservatives and tonicity agents may be used.

| Route Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Injection-Dependent | Requires **needle and propulsion device** (syringe, infusion pump) |
| Injection-Independent | No needle required but **must remain sterile** (e.g. inhalations, opthalmics, intranasal) |

## Injection Dependent Routes

Injection Dependent Routes involves delivering drugs directly into the body through **injection or infusion**.

 🔗 See [Injection Dependent Parenteral Routes of Administration](./injectables.md) for more information.

## Injection Independent routes

### Intraocular Route

`Local administration to the eye for therapeutic or anesthetic purposes`

#### 🔑 Intraocular Overview

- Treatment of **infections**, **inflammation**, **glaucoma**, **dry eye**, or **allergies**
- Local **anesthesia** for diagnostic or surgical procedures

> 🛡️ All ophthalmic preparations must be **sterile**, **free of particulates**, and **preserved** when multi-use.

⚙️ **Requirements for Ophthalmic Products**

- **Sterility**: Final product must be sterile at time of dispensing
- **pH**: Should match tear pH (~7.4) to minimize irritation
- **Tonicity**: Should be **isotonic** or close to tear osmolarity
- **Viscosity**: Carefully adjusted for **comfort** and **contact time**
- **Preservatives**: Used in **multi-dose containers**; preservative-free formulations are needed for **sensitive eyes**

> ☣️ The **eye is highly sensitive**. Improper pH, osmolality, or microbial contamination can result in pain, damage, or infection.

⚗️ **Formulation Types**

| Type | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Aqueous Solutions** | Sterile water-based drops | 💧 Most common. Easy to use. **Fast washout** from eye. **~80% dose lost** due to overflow and drainage. |
| **Aqueous Suspensions** | Contain suspended drug particles | 🕒 Longer contact than solutions. **Shake well** before use. |
| **Ointments** | Semi-solid base (mineral oil, petrolatum; melting point close to body temperature) | 🌙 Used at night due to **blurred vision**. **Prolonged contact time**. Difficult to wash out. |
| **Soluble Inserts** | Drug-embedded contact lenses | 🧊 Slow, continuous release via tear erosion |
| **Implants** | Solid dosage forms placed in the eye | ⚙️ May require surgical placement. Used for long-term therapy. |

🧠 **Basic Eye Anatomy (for Drug Delivery Context)**

- **Lacrimal Gland**: Secretes tears that flow across the eye surface
- **Canalicula**: Small ducts that drain tears into the nose
- **Lacrimal Sac**: Collects tears from canaliculi; drains into nasal cavity

> 📍 Drugs entering the lacrimal drainage system may be **absorbed systemically**, bypassing first-pass metabolism.

📊 **Challenges in Ocular Drug Delivery**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overflow** | Eyedroppers deliver **~50 µL**, but the eye holds only **~10 µL**; resulting in **>80% loss** |
| **Tear Drainage** | Tears flow from the **lacrimal gland** across the eye and drain into the **canalicula**, flushing the drug |
| **Tear Turnover** | Natural tear rate is **2 µL/min**, replacing entire tear volume every **2–3 minutes** |
| **Systemic Absorption** | Drained drug can enter the **GI tract** via nasolacrimal duct through the **lacrimal sac**, causing unintended systemic exposure |
| **Conjunctival Absorption** | Drug may be absorbed by **conjunctiva** (lining of the eyelid) |
| **Ideal Dose Volume** | **5–10 µL**, but most patients have access to droppers that are not that precise |

> 📍 1mL = 20 gtt

<!-- #### 🔢 How to Use Opthalmic Drops

> 🛡️ The eye is a sterile environment. Contamination of the product can result in **serious infection**.

1. **Wash hands** thoroughly with soap and warm water.
2. **Inspect the product**:
   - Ensure solution is **clear and colorless** (unless otherwise labeled).
   - **Discard** if it appears cloudy, discolored, or expired.
3. If using a **rubber-bulb dropper**:
   - Squeeze to draw up a small volume for administration.
4. **Positioning**:
   - Tilt head back with **chin up**, looking at the ceiling.
5. **Form the conjunctival sac**:
   - Use index finger to gently **pull down lower eyelid** of the affected eye.
   - A small "gutter" (pocket) will form.
6. **Instill the drop**:
   - Hold dropper **close to the eye** without touching any surface.
   - Instill **one drop** into the conjunctival sac.
7. **Post-instillation**:
   - **Do not blink** for at least **30 seconds**.
   - **Gently press the inner corner** of the eye (nasolacrimal duct) with a fingertip for **1 full minute** to prevent drainage and systemic absorption.
8. **Recap the bottle** tightly to maintain sterility.

>📍 **Ophthalmic Ointments** are supplied in **3.5 g tubes** with **narrow-gauge tips**. Administer by applying a thin **ribbon** inside the lower eyelid. -->

⚠️ **Important Warnings**

- Avoid **touching the dropper tip** to the eye, hands, or any surface.
- If **irritation**, **pain**, or **redness increases**, discontinue use immediately and consult a pharmacist or physician.
- Avoid **eye makeup** or contact lenses unless directed by a healthcare provider.
- Use a **mirror** or request assistance if coordination is difficult.

### Intranasal Route

`Highly vascularized route; allows for rapid systemic absorption in some cases`

#### 🔑 Intranasal Overview

- The **nasal cavity** has a total volume of ~20 mL and a **large surface area** lined with **rich capillary beds**, making it highly suitable for both **local** and **systemic** drug delivery.
- Absorption through the nasal mucosa can produce **plasma drug concentrations comparable to intravenous (IV)** administration for certain drugs.

🩺 **Common Uses**

- **Local**: Decongestants, antihistamines, corticosteroids
- **Systemic**: Hormones (e.g. calcitonin, desmopressin), analgesics, vaccines

⚗️ **Dosage Forms**

| Formulation Type | Delivery Mode | Notes |
|------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Solutions** | Drops or fine mist | Simple; but drops often drain (post nasal drip) and are swallowed |
| **Suspensions** | Spray or aerosol | Longer contact time on mucosa |
| **Sprays** | Metered spray | Preferred over drops; minimizes drainage and swallowing |
| **Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDI)** | Actuator device | More accurate dosing than squeeze bottles |
| **Aerosols** | Pressurized canister | Used when **particle size** matters for deposition |
| **Inhalers** | Volatile drug systems | Contain fibrous matrix saturated with volatile agents |
| **Ointments / Gels** | Direct application | Longer residence time; less drainage risk |

🧪 **Challenges to Absorption**

- **Enzymatic degradation**: Nasal mucosa contains metabolic enzymes (e.g. peptidases, cytochrome P450s) that can degrade certain drugs.
- **Mucociliary clearance**: Constant movement of mucus removes foreign substances and can reduce contact time.
- **Swallowing of dose**: Some of the drug may pass into the throat and be swallowed, leading to **unintended systemic effects** or **first-pass metabolism**.

🚨 **Risks and Limitations**

- **Mucosal edema** (swelling) and **rebound congestion** can occur with overuse.
- Should not be used **continuously** for more than **3–5 days** unless directed by a physician.
- Chronic misuse can lead to **rhinitis medicamentosa** (drug-induced chronic nasal inflammation).

> 📍 Nasal sprays and aerosols are engineered for **precise particle size** and **targeted deposition**. Use only as directed to avoid mucosal damage or systemic overdose.

<!-- #### 🔢 How to Use Nasal Sprays

1. **Blow your nose gently** to clear the nostrils.
2. **Wash hands** thoroughly with soap and warm water.
3. **Hold head upright** (do not tilt back).
4. **Close one nostril** using a finger; **keep mouth closed**.
5. **Insert the spray tip** into the open nostril.
   - Aim the nozzle slightly outward, away from the nasal septum.
6. **Inhale deeply** through the nose **while simultaneously activating** the spray (squeeze bottle or press MDI actuator).
7. **Hold your breath** momentarily, then **exhale through the mouth**.
8. **Repeat** for the other nostril if prescribed.
9. **Wipe or rinse the nozzle** with hot water. Do not share spray devices.
10. **Recap the device** and store it properly.
11. **Wash hands** again after use.

> 🛡️ Proper use minimizes irritation, prevents contamination, and ensures consistent dosing.
> 🚨 Avoid directing spray toward the septum. Long-term damage may occur. -->
