# Parenteral Routes of Administration

**Parenteral administration** involves delivering drugs while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

🔑 Used when:

- Oral absorption is poor or unreliable
- The drug is degraded by the GI tract
- A **rapid or controlled** response is needed
- The patient is **unconscious, uncooperative, vomiting**, or **unable to swallow**

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- **Higher cost** due to sterile preparation and storage
- **Requires trained personnel** to administer (especially for IV, IM)
- **Difficult to reverse** in case of adverse or toxic reactions
- Risk of **infection, phlebitis, infiltration, or nerve injury**

> 🛡️ Must be **sterile** and **pyrogen-free**; preservatives and tonicity agents may be used.

| Route Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔗 [Injection-Dependent](#injection-dependent-routes) | Requires **needle and propulsion device** (syringe, infusion pump) |
| 🔗 [Injection-Independent](#injection-independent-routes) | No needle required but **must remain sterile** (e.g. inhalations, opthalmics, intranasal) |

## Injection Dependent Routes

Injection Dependent Routes involves delivering drugs directly into the body through **injection or infusion**.

| Route | Description | Common Uses/ Drugs |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| 🔗 [Intravenous (IV)](#intravenous-route) | Injected **directly into the vein**. Provides **immediate systemic effect**. Ideal for **large volumes**, **continuous infusion**, or **small volumes** of drugs with **narrow therapeutic windows** | Fluids (e.g. D5W, NS), blood products, fat emulsions, Patient Controlled Analgesia(PCA) |
| 🔗 [Intramuscular (IM)](#intramuscular-route) | Injected **deep into muscle tissue**. Slower onset than IV, but longer duration. | haloperidol, prochlorperazine, **iron dextran**, olanzapine, ziprasidone, metoclopramide |
| 🔗 [Subcutaneous (SC or SubQ)](#subcutaneous-route) | Injected or **implanted** into the **fatty tissue** just under the skin. Slower absorption than IM. | insulin, enoxaparin, heparin, vaccines |
| 🔗 [Intradermal (ID)](#intradermal-route) | Injected into the **dermal layer** of skin at an angle. | immunization, desensitization, **allergy testing**, & **diagnostics**  (e.g. tuberculin tests) |

### Injectable Formulations & Administration

#### 🧰 Injection Devices & Performance

- **Syringe**: consists of plunger, barrel, and needle. Used for injections under 2 minutes
  - Some products come preassembled and prefilled reduce contamination and improve convenience!
- **Syringeability**: ease of drawing fluid from container
- **Injectability**: ease of injecting fluid through needle
Administered by needle

📏 **Needle Gauge & Length by Route**

| Route | Gauge; Length |
|-------|---------------|
| IV | 16–20G; 1–1.5" |
| IM | 19–22G; 1–1.5" |
| Subcutaneous | 24–27G; 3/8–1" |
| Intradermal | 25–26G; 3/8" |

>- 🚨 Smaller gauge = larger diameter.  
>- 🛡️ Use **aseptic technique** to reduce infection risk.

#### ⚗️ Injectable Formulations

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Solutions** | Most common. May be aqueous (e.g. SWFI, Bacteriostatic Water, NS) or nonaqueous (e.g. glycols, alcohols) |
| **Suspensions** | Difficult to formulate; require careful attention to syringeability and injectability |
| **Emulsions** | Typically oil-in-water, sometimes water-in-oil; used for nutrition (TPN), lipophilic drugs |
| **Lyophilized Powders** | Freeze-dried drugs for reconstitution before injection. Diluent varies by product; refer to package insert |

🛡️ **Considerations**

To protect sensitive and vital organs, parenteral formulations must:

- **Sterile** and **particulate-free**
- Have **controlled pH and osmolality**
- Use **non-toxic excipients**
- Be packaged in **sterile, sealed containers** (vials, ampules, prefilled syringes)
- Preservative-free unless labeled for **multi-dose** use

> ☣️ Injection-dependent parenteral routes **bypass all natural protective barriers**, increasing risk of systemic toxicity and infection. Caution is essential.

### Intravenous Route

`Direct access to systemic circulation = immediate onset`  

⏱️ **Complete distribution occurs within ~20 seconds**

#### 🔑 Overview

IV administration delivers drug **directly into the vein**, bypassing all absorption barriers. It allows **precise control** over blood concentrations, making it ideal for **emergent therapies**, **electrolyte correction**, **continuous infusions**, and **drugs with narrow therapeutic indices**.

⚗️ **Dosage Forms Suitable for IV Use**

| Formulation Type | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| **Solutions** | Most common; primarily aqueous (SWFI, NS, D5W). May include co-solvents like alcohols, glycols, or polysorbates for solubilization |
| **Suspensions** | Rarely used; risk of emboli and poor syringeability/injectability |
| **Emulsions** | e.g. **Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)**; lipid-based for caloric support |
| **Lyophilized Powders** | Freeze-dried products requiring **reconstitution** with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI); diluent specified in package insert |

🚨 **IV-Specific Risks & Complications**

- **Thrombus**, or blood clots, can be caused by:
  - extreme pH or osmolarity  
  - particulate contamination (glass, rubber)
  - trauma from catheter or needle  
  - small or fragile veins  
  - irritant or vesicant drugs
- **Phlebitis**, or inflammation of vein, can be caused by:
  - mechanical irritation  
  - chemical irritation  
  - microbial contamination
- **Air Embolism**, or air entering the system, potentially blocks blood flow and **can be fatal**.
  - Always prime IV sets  
  - Expel air from syringes, tubing, and connectors
- **Infiltration** is when IV fluid enters surrounding tissue due to dislodged catheter or vein rupture.
- **Extravasation** is the infiltration of a **vesicant drug** (e.g. chemo, dopamine) causing tissue necrosis.

> 🛡️ **Final in-line filters** are often used to protect against particulates and microbial contaminants. Mandatory for certain drugs and biologics.

🧭 **Common IV Access Sites**

| Region    | Access Veins | Clinical Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Hand**  | Dorsal metacarpal veins, dorsal venous arch | Easy to access; small gauge only |
| **Arm**   | Cephalic, basilic, and median cubital veins | Most common; good for short- and mid-term infusions |
| **Foot**  | Dorsalis pedis vein | Used when upper extremity access is unavailable; avoid in diabetic patients |
| **Central/Surgical** | Internal jugular, subclavian, femoral | For central lines (PICC, tunneled, or implanted ports); used for long-term, high-osmolarity, or irritant drugs |

> ☣️ Central lines are **high-risk** access points requiring **strict sterile technique** and **skilled insertion**. Central access is often needed for TPN, chemo, or prolonged antibiotic therapy.

📍 **Documentation Reminder**  

Always document:

- Site of access  
- Needle/catheter gauge  
- Time of initiation  
- Volume and drug administered  
- Complications (if any)

#### 🔄 Infusions

**Infusion** refers to the **gradual intravenous (IV) administration** of fluid over a set period. This method ensures steady-state drug levels and is often used for hydration, nutritional support, or continuous drug delivery.

| Type               | Volume           | Common Uses                                     |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Large Volume (LVP)**  | 500 mL – 1,000 mL  | Hydration, electrolyte replacement, parenteral nutrition |
| **Small Volume (SVP)**  | <100 mL           | Drug administration via **IV piggyback** or **IV push**  |

🛠 **IV Infusion Equipment**

- **IV Bag Ports**:
  - **Administration Port**:  
    - Connects to the **primary IV administration set**
    - Can accept **piggybacked (secondary)** IV lines for intermittent medications (e.g. antibiotics)
    - Secondary line hangs higher than the primary to infuse by gravity
  - **Medication Port**:  
    - Intended for injecting medications **directly into the bag** before hanging
    - Requires **aseptic technique** and proper mixing

- **Administration Set** (IV tubing):
  - Connects the **bag to the IV access site**
  - Includes **drip chamber**, **roller clamp**, **injection ports**, and **final filter**
  - **Final Filters**:
    - Remove glass, rubber, or particulate contaminants
    - Often required for:
      - Lipid emulsions (TPN)
      - Reconstituted biologics
      - Hazardous or sensitive drugs
  - **Flow Control Devices**:
    - **Gravity Drip Sets**:
      - Less precise; rate adjusted manually via **drip count**
    - **Infusion Pumps**:  
      - Deliver fluids at a **precise and programmable rate**
      - Critical for drugs with **narrow therapeutic ranges** (e.g. potassium chloride, vasopressors)
    - **Elastomeric Pumps**:
      - Balloon-like reservoir exerts pressure to deliver medication through a flow restrictor
      - Used for **ambulatory care**, **home infusions**, or **slow intermittent therapy**

🛡️ **Clinical Safety Note**

- Match **infusion rate** and **fluid volume** to patient condition:
  - ⚠️ Too fast → fluid overload, pulmonary edema, or cardiac stress
  - ⚠️ Too slow → therapeutic failure or subtherapeutic exposure
- Always **monitor infusion site** for:
  - Infiltration
  - Phlebitis
  - Infection
  - Dislodgement or occlusion

> 📍 For high-alert medications, double-check pump settings and line compatibility before administration.
