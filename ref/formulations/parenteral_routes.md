# Parenteral Routes of Administration

**Parenteral administration** involves delivering drugs while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

üîë Used when:

- Oral absorption is poor or unreliable
- The drug is degraded by the GI tract
- A **rapid or controlled** response is needed
- The patient is **unconscious, uncooperative, vomiting**, or **unable to swallow**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

- **Higher cost** due to sterile preparation and storage
- **Requires trained personnel** to administer (especially for IV, IM)
- **Difficult to reverse** in case of adverse or toxic reactions
- Risk of **infection, phlebitis, infiltration, or nerve injury**

> üõ°Ô∏è Must be **sterile** and **pyrogen-free**; preservatives and tonicity agents may be used.

| Route Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Injection-Dependent | Requires **needle and propulsion device** (syringe, infusion pump) |
| Injection-Independent | No needle required but **must remain sterile** (e.g. inhalations, opthalmics, intranasal) |

## Injection Dependent Routes

Injection Dependent Routes involves delivering drugs directly into the body through **injection or infusion**.

 üîó See [Injection Dependent Parenteral Routes of Administration](./injectables.md) for more information.

## Injection Independent routes

### Opthalmic Route

`Local administration to the eye for therapeutic or anesthetic purposes`

üîë **Purpose**

- Treatment of **infections**, **inflammation**, **glaucoma**, **dry eye**, or **allergies**
- Local **anesthesia** for diagnostic or surgical procedures

> üõ°Ô∏è All ophthalmic preparations must be **sterile**, **free of particulates**, and **preserved** when multi-use.

‚öôÔ∏è **Requirements for Ophthalmic Products**

- **Sterility**: Final product must be sterile at time of dispensing
- **pH**: Should match tear pH (~7.4) to minimize irritation
- **Tonicity**: Should be **isotonic** or close to tear osmolarity
- **Viscosity**: Carefully adjusted for **comfort** and **contact time**
- **Preservatives**: Used in **multi-dose containers**; preservative-free formulations are needed for **sensitive eyes**

> ‚ò£Ô∏è The **eye is highly sensitive**. Improper pH, osmolality, or microbial contamination can result in pain, damage, or infection.

‚öóÔ∏è **Formulation Types**

| Type | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Aqueous Solutions** | Sterile water-based drops | üíß Most common. Easy to use. **Fast washout** from eye. **~80% dose lost** due to overflow and drainage. |
| **Aqueous Suspensions** | Contain suspended drug particles | üïí Longer contact than solutions. **Shake well** before use. |
| **Ointments** | Semi-solid base (mineral oil, petrolatum; melting point close to body temperature) | üåô Used at night due to **blurred vision**. **Prolonged contact time**. Difficult to wash out. |
| **Soluble Inserts** | Drug-embedded contact lenses | üßä Slow, continuous release via tear erosion |
| **Implants** | Solid dosage forms placed in the eye | ‚öôÔ∏è May require surgical placement. Used for long-term therapy. |

üß† **Basic Eye Anatomy (for Drug Delivery Context)**

- **Lacrimal Gland**: Secretes tears that flow across the eye surface
- **Canalicula**: Small ducts that drain tears into the nose
- **Lacrimal Sac**: Collects tears from canaliculi; drains into nasal cavity

> üìç Drugs entering the lacrimal drainage system may be **absorbed systemically**, bypassing first-pass metabolism.

üìä **Challenges in Ocular Drug Delivery**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overflow** | Eyedroppers deliver **~50 ¬µL**, but the eye holds only **~10 ¬µL**; resulting in **>80% loss** |
| **Tear Drainage** | Tears flow from the **lacrimal gland** across the eye and drain into the **canalicula**, flushing the drug |
| **Tear Turnover** | Natural tear rate is **2 ¬µL/min**, replacing entire tear volume every **2‚Äì3 minutes** |
| **Systemic Absorption** | Drained drug can enter the **GI tract** via nasolacrimal duct through the **lacrimal sac**, causing unintended systemic exposure |
| **Conjunctival Absorption** | Drug may be absorbed by **conjunctiva** (lining of the eyelid) |
| **Ideal Dose Volume** | **5‚Äì10 ¬µL**, but most patients have access to droppers that are not that precise |

#### üî¢ How to Use Opthalmic Drops

> üõ°Ô∏è The eye is a sterile environment. Contamination of the product can result in **serious infection**.

1. **Wash hands** thoroughly with soap and warm water.
2. **Inspect the product**:
   - Ensure solution is **clear and colorless** (unless otherwise labeled).
   - **Discard** if it appears cloudy, discolored, or expired.
3. If using a **rubber-bulb dropper**:
   - Squeeze to draw up a small volume for administration.
4. **Positioning**:
   - Tilt head back with **chin up**, looking at the ceiling.
5. **Form the conjunctival sac**:
   - Use index finger to gently **pull down lower eyelid** of the affected eye.
   - A small "gutter" (pocket) will form.
6. **Instill the drop**:
   - Hold dropper **close to the eye** without touching any surface.
   - Instill **one drop** into the conjunctival sac.
7. **Post-instillation**:
   - **Do not blink** for at least **30 seconds**.
   - **Gently press the inner corner** of the eye (nasolacrimal duct) with a fingertip for **1 full minute** to prevent drainage and systemic absorption.
8. **Recap the bottle** tightly to maintain sterility.

>üìç **Ophthalmic Ointments** are supplied in **3.5 g tubes** with **narrow-gauge tips**. Administer by applying a thin **ribbon** inside the lower eyelid.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

- Avoid **touching the dropper tip** to the eye, hands, or any surface.
- If **irritation**, **pain**, or **redness increases**, discontinue use immediately and consult a pharmacist or physician.
- Avoid **eye makeup** or contact lenses unless directed by a healthcare provider.
- Use a **mirror** or request assistance if coordination is difficult.
