# Parenteral Routes of Administration

**Parenteral administration** involves delivering drugs while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

🔑 Used when:

- Oral absorption is poor or unreliable
- The drug is degraded by the GI tract
- A **rapid or controlled** response is needed
- The patient is **unconscious, uncooperative, vomiting**, or **unable to swallow**

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- **Higher cost** due to sterile preparation and storage
- **Requires trained personnel** to administer (especially for IV, IM)
- **Difficult to reverse** in case of adverse or toxic reactions
- Risk of **infection, phlebitis, infiltration, or nerve injury**

> 🛡️ Must be **sterile** and **pyrogen-free**; preservatives and tonicity agents may be used.

| Route Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Injection-Dependent | Requires **needle and propulsion device** (syringe, infusion pump) |
| Injection-Independent | No needle required but **must remain sterile** (e.g. inhalations, opthalmics, intranasal) |

## Injection Dependent Routes

Injection Dependent Routes involves delivering drugs directly into the body through **injection or infusion**.

 🔗 See [Injection Dependent Parenteral Routes of Administration](./injectables.md) for more information.

## Injection Independent Routes

Parenteral routes bypass the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While most parenteral routes involve injections (e.g., IV, IM, SC), a subset deliver drugs **without needles or infusion devices**.

 🔗 See [Injection Dependent Parenteral Routes of Administration](./non_injectables.md) for more information.
