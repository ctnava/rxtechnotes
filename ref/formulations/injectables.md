## Injectable Formulations & Administration

### 🧰 Injection Devices & Performance

- **Syringe**: consists of plunger, barrel, and needle. Used for injections under 2 minutes
  - Some products come preassembled and prefilled reduce contamination and improve convenience!
- **Syringeability**: ease of drawing fluid from container
- **Injectability**: ease of injecting fluid through needle
Administered by needle

📏 **Needle Gauge & Length by Route**

| Route | Gauge; Length |
|-------|---------------|
| IV | 16–20G; 1–1.5" |
| IM | 19–22G; 1–1.5" |
| Subcutaneous | 24–27G; 3/8–1" |
| Intradermal | 25–26G; 3/8" |

>- 🚨 Smaller gauge = larger diameter.  
>- 🛡️ Use **aseptic technique** to reduce infection risk.

### ⚗️ Injectable Formulations

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Solutions** | Most common. May be aqueous (e.g. SWFI, Bacteriostatic Water, NS) or nonaqueous (e.g. glycols, alcohols) |
| **Suspensions** | Difficult to formulate; require careful attention to syringeability and injectability |
| **Emulsions** | Typically oil-in-water, sometimes water-in-oil; used for nutrition (TPN), lipophilic drugs |
| **Lyophilized Powders** | Freeze-dried drugs for reconstitution before injection. Diluent varies by product; refer to package insert |

🛡️ **Considerations**

To protect sensitive and vital organs, parenteral formulations must:

- **Sterile** and **particulate-free**
- Have **controlled pH and osmolality**
- Use **non-toxic excipients**
- Be packaged in **sterile, sealed containers** (vials, ampules, prefilled syringes)
- Preservative-free unless labeled for **multi-dose** use

> ☣️ Injection-dependent parenteral routes **bypass all natural protective barriers**, increasing risk of systemic toxicity and infection. Caution is essential.

## Intravenous Route

`Direct access to systemic circulation = immediate onset`  

⏱️ **Complete distribution occurs within ~20 seconds**

### 🔑 IV Overview

IV administration delivers drug **directly into the vein**, bypassing all absorption barriers. It allows **precise control** over blood concentrations, making it ideal for **emergent therapies**, **electrolyte correction**, **continuous infusions**, and **drugs with narrow therapeutic indices**.

⚗️ **Dosage Forms Suitable for IV Use**

| Formulation Type | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| **Solutions** | Most common; primarily aqueous (SWFI, NS, D5W). May include co-solvents like alcohols, glycols, or polysorbates for solubilization |
| **Suspensions** | Rarely used; risk of emboli and poor syringeability/injectability |
| **Emulsions** | e.g. **Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)**; lipid-based for caloric support |
| **Lyophilized Powders** | Freeze-dried products requiring **reconstitution** with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI); diluent specified in package insert |

🚨 **IV-Specific Risks & Complications**

- **Thrombus**, or blood clots, can be caused by:
  - extreme pH or osmolarity  
  - particulate contamination (glass, rubber)
  - trauma from catheter or needle  
  - small or fragile veins  
  - irritant or vesicant drugs
- **Phlebitis**, or inflammation of vein, can be caused by:
  - mechanical irritation  
  - chemical irritation  
  - microbial contamination
- **Air Embolism**, or air entering the system, potentially blocks blood flow and **can be fatal**.
  - Always prime IV sets  
  - Expel air from syringes, tubing, and connectors
- **Infiltration** is when IV fluid enters surrounding tissue due to dislodged catheter or vein rupture.
- **Extravasation** is the infiltration of a **vesicant drug** (e.g. chemo, dopamine) causing tissue necrosis.

> 🛡️ **Final in-line filters** are often used to protect against particulates and microbial contaminants. Mandatory for certain drugs and biologics.

🧭 **Common IV Access Sites**

| Region    | Access Veins | Clinical Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Hand**  | Dorsal metacarpal veins, dorsal venous arch | Easy to access; small gauge only |
| **Arm**   | Cephalic, basilic, and median cubital veins | Most common; good for short- and mid-term infusions |
| **Foot**  | Dorsalis pedis vein | Used when upper extremity access is unavailable; avoid in diabetic patients |
| **Central/Surgical** | Internal jugular, subclavian, femoral | For central lines (PICC, tunneled, or implanted ports); used for long-term, high-osmolarity, or irritant drugs |

> ☣️ Central lines are **high-risk** access points requiring **strict sterile technique** and **skilled insertion**. Central access is often needed for TPN, chemo, or prolonged antibiotic therapy.

📍 **Documentation Reminder**  

Always document:

- Site of access  
- Needle/catheter gauge  
- Time of initiation  
- Volume and drug administered  
- Complications (if any)

### 🔄 Infusions

**Infusion** refers to the **gradual intravenous (IV) administration** of fluid over a set period. This method ensures steady-state drug levels and is often used for hydration, nutritional support, or continuous drug delivery.

| Type               | Volume           | Common Uses                                     |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Large Volume (LVP)**  | 500 mL – 1,000 mL  | Hydration, electrolyte replacement, parenteral nutrition |
| **Small Volume (SVP)**  | <100 mL           | Drug administration via **IV piggyback** or **IV push**  |

🛠 **IV Infusion Equipment**

- **IV Bag Ports**:
  - **Administration Port**:  
    - Connects to the **primary IV administration set**
    - Can accept **piggybacked (secondary)** IV lines for intermittent medications (e.g. antibiotics)
    - Secondary line hangs higher than the primary to infuse by gravity
  - **Medication Port**:  
    - Intended for injecting medications **directly into the bag** before hanging
    - Requires **aseptic technique** and proper mixing

- **Administration Set** (IV tubing):
  - Connects the **bag to the IV access site**
  - Includes **drip chamber**, **roller clamp**, **injection ports**, and **final filter**
  - **Final Filters**:
    - Remove glass, rubber, or particulate contaminants
    - Often required for:
      - Lipid emulsions (TPN)
      - Reconstituted biologics
      - Hazardous or sensitive drugs
  - **Flow Control Devices**:
    - **Gravity Drip Sets**:
      - Less precise; rate adjusted manually via **drip count**
    - **Infusion Pumps**:  
      - Deliver fluids at a **precise and programmable rate**
      - Critical for drugs with **narrow therapeutic ranges** (e.g. potassium chloride, vasopressors)
    - **Elastomeric Pumps**:
      - Balloon-like reservoir exerts pressure to deliver medication through a flow restrictor
      - Used for **ambulatory care**, **home infusions**, or **slow intermittent therapy**

🛡️ **Clinical Safety Note**

- Match **infusion rate** and **fluid volume** to patient condition:
  - ⚠️ Too fast → fluid overload, pulmonary edema, or cardiac stress
  - ⚠️ Too slow → therapeutic failure or subtherapeutic exposure
- Always **monitor infusion site** for:
  - Infiltration
  - Phlebitis
  - Infection
  - Dislodgement or occlusion

> 📍 For high-alert medications, double-check pump settings and line compatibility before administration.

## Intramuscular Route

`Less hazardous and technically simpler than IV, but more painful`

### 🔑 IM Overview

Intramuscular administration involves injecting a drug **deep into the skeletal muscle**, where it forms a **depot** that enables **slower absorption** and **prolonged action** compared to IV. IM injections are useful for **poorly soluble drugs**, **extended-release formulations**, and when **moderate volumes** are required.

- **Onset**: Slower than IV  
- **Duration**: Longer than IV  
- **Absorption influenced by**:
  - **Muscle activity** (blood flow)
  - **Formulation properties** (particle size, vehicle)
  - **Salt form** of the drug

⚗️ **Acceptable IM Formulations**

| Type         | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| **Aqueous Solutions** | Fastest absorption |
| **Oleaginous Solutions** | Slower, prolonged release; increased irritation risk |
| **Suspensions** | Require shaking; slow, sustained release |
| **Colloids / Emulsions** | Oil-in-water (o/w) or water-in-oil (w/o); particle size, emulsion type, and salt form modulate release rate |

> 🛡️ All IM formulations must be **sterile**, **non-pyrogenic**, and free from particulate contamination.

🚨 **Risks & Complications**

| Complication      | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Abscess**       | Sterile or infected localized collection of pus |
| **Cysts**         | Form due to poor technique or poor drug absorption |
| **Embolism**      | From accidental injection into blood vessel |
| **Hematoma**      | Accumulation of blood from punctured vessels |
| **Skin Sloughing**| Necrosis or peeling of skin layers |
| **Scar Formation**| Repeated trauma to tissue |

🧭 **Common IM Injection Sites**

| Site | Region | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Gluteus maximus** | Buttocks | Large volume tolerance (up to 5 mL); avoid sciatic nerve |
| **Deltoid muscle**  | Upper arm | Convenient for small-volume injections (≤ 2 mL); risk of hitting radial nerve if poorly placed |
| **Vastus lateralis**| Thigh | Preferred in infants and small children; moderate volume (~2 mL) |
| **Ventrogluteal**   | Hip | Safe site; away from major nerves and blood vessels |

>- 📍 IM sites should be chosen to avoid proximity to **major nerves and blood vessels**.
>- 📍 Doses >3 mL should be split between two sites unless specifically indicated otherwise.
>- 🛡️ Always rotate injection sites to prevent muscle fibrosis, local irritation, scar & abscess formation

🎯 **Z-Track Technique**

Used to minimize **drug leakage**, **tissue staining**, and **irritation**:

1. Pull the skin and subcutaneous tissue laterally.
2. Inject the drug into the muscle.
3. Release the skin to **seal off the track**.

> 🛡️ Recommended for:
>
>- Iron dextran
>- Hydroxyprogesterone
>- Drugs that discolor skin or irritate subcutaneous tissues

## Subcutaneous Route

`Versatile route suitable for both short-term and extended-release therapies`

### 🔑 SubQ Overview

Subcutaneous administration involves injecting medication into the **fatty tissue beneath the dermis** and above the muscle layer. It is used when **slow, consistent absorption** is desired.

- **Onset**: Slower than IM due to lower vascularity
- **Duration**: Can support short-term or **very long-term** therapies
- **Volume Limit**: Typically **0.5–1.5 mL** per injection

> 📍 Useful for self-administration due to ease of access and minimal training requirements.

⚗️ **Absorption Influencers**

Absorption from subcutaneous tissue is largely influenced by same factors as intramuscular injections.

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Blood supply** | Fewer vessels = slower uptake |
| **Heat or Massage** | Increases absorption rate |
| **Co-administered Drugs** | Vasodilators may speed up absorption; vasoconstrictors slow it down |
| **Formulation Type** | Suspension or viscous solutions slow absorption |

🚨 **Risks & Complications**

| Risk | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Abscess** | May occur with improper aseptic technique |
| **Tissue Necrosis** | Often linked to irritant drugs or repeated injections |
| **Pain** | Dependent on needle size, volume, and formulation |

🧭 **Common Injection Sites**

| Site | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Lower abdomen** | Avoid 2-inch radius around navel |
| **Anterior thigh** | Easy self-access |
| **Upper back** | Less common, used in clinical settings |
| **Back of upper arm** | Common for vaccinations or biologics |

> 🛡️ **Rotate sites** to avoid lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy, or irritation.

### 🧪 Subcutaneous Implants

SubQ implants are designed to deliver **sustained-release** medications over weeks, months, or even years.

- **Placement**: Implanted into the subcutaneous tissue using:
  - **Surgical incision** or
  - **Specialized implant syringe**
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Must be **biocompatible**
  - Must not cause **irritation**, **infection**, or **abscess formation**
- **Advantages**:
  - Long duration with single administration
  - **Easily removable** if needed
  - Ideal for **hormones**, **opioid antagonists**, **contraceptives**, etc.

🔙 **Ports and Pumps in SubQ Tissue**

Subcutaneous tissue can serve as a **site for infusion access** via **implanted ports** or **elastomeric pumps**:

- **Function**: Ports deliver medication through **catheters** inserted into:
  - **Veins**
  - **Body cavities**
  - **Arteries**
  - **CNS spaces**
- **Indications**:
  - **Chemotherapy**
  - **Long-term antibiotics**
  - **Pain management**

> 🛡️ These systems allow **continuous infusion** without repeated needle sticks, improving patient comfort and compliance.

## Intradermal Route

`Shallow injection into the top layer of skin (dermis), primarily for diagnostics and immunologic use`

### 🔑 ID Overview

Intradermal administration delivers **small volumes (0.1 mL or less)** directly into the **dermis**, the layer beneath the **epidermis**.

- **Absorption**: **Extremely slow** due to limited vascularity
- **Effect**: Can be **local** (skin reaction) or **systemic**
- **Depot effect**: Drug forms a **wheal** (small, raised blister) from which it is gradually absorbed

> 📍 The **wheal** is a visible sign of correct administration.

📍 **Common Injection Site**

- **Anterior forearm**: Most common and accessible site for intradermal administration

> 🛡️ Aseptic technique is essential to prevent localized infection or abscess formation.

🚨 **Important Considerations**

- **Needle size**: Typically **25–27 gauge**, **3/8 inch**
- **Angle of injection**: **5–15 degrees** with the bevel facing up
- **Injection volume**: Usually **0.1 mL**
- **Technique**:
  - Stretch the skin taut
  - Insert needle at shallow angle
  - Inject slowly to form a **wheal**
- **Do not massage** the site afterward; may affect drug absorption or test interpretation

> 📍 The dermis contains **more blood vessels than the epidermis**, but **fewer than IM or SC tissues**, accounting for the very slow absorption rate.
