# Enteral Routes of Administration

**Enteral administration** refers to any method of delivering drugs into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This includes the **oral**, **sublingual**, **buccal**, and **rectal** routes. These methods differ in terms of absorption site, onset of action, formulation types, and whether they are subject to **first-pass metabolism** in the liver.

Some enteral routes are designed to deliver medication **systemically**, while others act **locally** within the GI tract. Understanding the differences is critical for determining the appropriate route and formulation for a given drug or patient condition.

| Route | Associated Dosage Forms |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Oral (PO)** | Tablets, Capsules, Bulk Powders, Solutions, Suspensions, Elixirs, Syrups, Emulsions |
| **Sublingual (SL)** | Tablets, Solutions, Lozenges |
| **Buccal (Bucc)** | Tablets, Lozenges, Solutions |
| **Rectal (PR)** | Suppositories, Solutions (Enemas), Ointments |

| **👄 Oral** | Swallowed, absorbed via stomach or intestines | [Oral Route](#-oral-route) |
| **👅 Sublingual** | Placed under the tongue, absorbed via mucosa | [Sublingual & Buccal Routes](#-sublingual--buccal-routes) |
| **👅 Buccal** | Placed between cheek and gum, absorbed via mucosa | [Sublingual & Buccal Routes](#-sublingual--buccal-routes) |
| **🍑 Rectal** | Inserted into the rectum, absorbed via rectal veins | [Rectal Route](#-rectal-route) |

## 👄 Oral Route

Per os (`PO`), Latin for "by mouth", is the most frequently used route of drug administration.

Drugs administered orally pass through the stomach, which has a very **acidic pH (1–2)**. Some drugs **cannot** be administered orally because they are **degraded or inactivated** by gastric acid or enzymes.

> 📍 **Food Intake Warning**: The presence of food can **delay, reduce, or enhance** drug absorption depending on the formulation and the drug's properties.

### 💊 Oral Solid Formulations

Solid dosage forms must typically undergo two processes:

- **Disintegration**: Breaking apart into smaller particles
- **Dissolution**: Dissolving into solution for absorption

Only dissolved drug molecules can cross gastrointestinal membranes and enter systemic circulation.

#### 🔄 Modified Release Formulations

**Modified-release** formulations alter the timing and/or location of drug release. These reduce dosing frequency and may offer steadier blood concentrations.

Common terms include:

| Abbreviation | Meaning              |
|--------------|----------------------|
| SR           | Sustained Release     |
| SA           | Sustained Action      |
| ER / XR      | Extended Release      |
| PA           | Prolonged Action      |
| CR           | Controlled Release    |
| TR           | Time Release          |
| LA           | Long Acting           |

> 🛡️ **Do NOT crush, split, or chew** modified-release, layered, or coated formulations unless specifically labeled as safe to do so.

#### ⚪ Tablets

**Tablets** are hard, compressed formulations made by pressing active and inactive ingredients into a solid shape. Common types include:

- **Film or sugar-coated tablets**: For taste masking or protection
- **Scored tablets**: Designed to be safely split
- **Multiple-compressed tablets**: Two-layer or compression-coated, often for combination or staged release
- **Repeated action tablets**: Release a portion of the dose immediately, followed by another later
- **Chewable tablets**: Intended to be chewed before swallowing
- **Effervescent tablets**: Dissolved in water before ingestion

> 🚨 **Enteric-coated tablets** resist stomach acid and disintegrate only at the higher pH of the **small intestine**.  
> 🛡️ **Do not cut or crush** enteric-coated, layered, or time-release tablets.

#### 💊 Capsules

**Capsules** are solid dosage forms in which drugs and excipients are enclosed in a **gelatin shell**.

Key features:

- **Hard gelatin capsules**: Usually contain powder or pellets (small tablets)
- **Softgels**: Contain **predissolved drugs in a liquid base**
- **Gelatin dissolves**, releasing the contents, which must then dissolve into solution for absorption

> 📍 Capsule size depends on the volume of contents. Smaller numbers indicate **larger** capsule sizes (i.e. 000 to 5).

#### 📨 Bulk Powders

**Bulk powders** are loose powder forms packaged in folded paper or foil pouches. They contain:

- The active drug
- Optional excipients that aid dissolution or flavor

Usage:

- Poured onto the back of the tongue and swallowed
- Or dissolved in water or a flavored beverage before ingestion

> 📍 Bulk powders bypass the **disintegration** step and dissolve directly, potentially leading to **faster onset** than tablets or capsules.

### 🥤 Oral Liquid Formulations

Oral **liquid formulations** deliver the drug in a pre-dissolved or suspended form, bypassing the need for **disintegration** and, in some cases, **dissolution**. This generally leads to **faster absorption** compared to solid oral dosage forms.

#### 💧 Solutions

**Solutions** are homogeneous mixtures in which one or more substances (**solutes**) are completely dissolved in a **solvent**. They are **clear** (not necessarily colorless) and contain no undissolved particles.

Types of oral solutions:

- **Aqueous solutions**: Water is the solvent. Most common type.
  - **Syrups**:
    - Aqueous solutions saturated with **sucrose** or other sugars
    - Viscous, sweet, and flavored
    - Contain **<10% alcohol**
  - **Elixirs**:
    - Clear, sweetened **hydroalcoholic** solutions
    - Used for alcohol or water-soluble drugs
    - Less viscous and less sweet than syrups
    - Alcohol content ranges from **5–40%**

- **Nonaqueous solutions**: Solvent is primarily **not water**. Only a limited number of nonaqueous solvents are allowed due to toxicity concerns (e.g. Glycerine, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol).

- **Spirits / Essences**:
  - Alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of **volatile substances** (e.g., essential oils)
  - Alcohol content: **62–85%**
  - Used for flavoring or mild medicinal effects

- **Tinctures**:
  - Alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of **nonvolatile substances**
  - **10% drug strength** for potent drugs
  - **20% drug strength** for non-potent drugs

📌 **Considerations**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Homogeneous doses | Shorter shelf life (less chemically stable) |
| Faster absorption | Poor taste may require masking |
| Suitable for patients unable to swallow solids | Bulky and heavy to store/transport |
| Easy to adjust doses | May require dosing tools (oral syringes, cups) |
|  | Some drugs are not soluble in acceptable solvents |

#### 🌫️ Suspensions

**Suspensions** are **heterogeneous** mixtures in which the drug is suspended as fine particles in a liquid. The drug **does not dissolve** completely.

- 🛡️ Must be **shaken well** before each dose to ensure uniformity
- Flavored and sweetened to improve palatability

**Reconstitution**:

- Many suspensions are sold as **lyophilized powders** (freeze-dried)
- Require **reconstitution** with water before use
- Common in pediatric antibiotics

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Allows administration of **insoluble drugs** | Particles **settle over time** |
| Chemically **more stable** than in solution | Texture may be gritty or unpleasant |
| Masks taste |  |
| Suitable for patients who can't take solids |  |

#### Colloidal Dispersions

Colloids are mixtures where **small particles** (1–1000 nanometers) are dispersed throughout a medium. They are intermediate between solutions and suspensions.

##### 🧴 Emulsions

**Emulsions** are **liquid–liquid** dispersions of two immiscible phases (usually oleaginous (oil) and aqueous). One phase is dispersed into the other as **droplets**, stabilized by an **emulsifying agent**.

- **Oil-in-Water (o/w)**: Water is continuous phase; oil is dispersed
- **Water-in-Oil (w/o)**: Oil is continuous phase; water is dispersed

Notes:

- Emulsions for oral use are rare due to **instability** and **oily texture**
- Used when oral solubility or bioavailability of a drug are greatly increased or for better flavoring agents
- Common in **topical** dosage forms
- **Creaming**: droplets rise/fall but can be **re-dispersed** by shaking
- **Coalescence**: irreversible merging of droplets (product failure)

> 🛡️ Must be shaken well before each use. Visually inspect for separation.

##### 🌿 Gels

**Gels** are **semi-solid** systems where a **liquid phase is dispersed within a solid matrix** formed by gelling agents. They are sometimes used orally, though more common topically.

Key characteristics:

- Require **12–24 hours** to reach full viscosity and clarity
- Sometimes easier to incorporate the drug **before gel formation**
- **Agent Concentration**: 0.5% – 10%
- Gelling agents used orally:
  - **Carbomers**
  - **Methylcellulose**
  - **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)**
  - **Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC)**

> 📍 Avoid using gelling agents not labeled for oral use. Some are only appropriate for topical or ophthalmic formulations.

### 👅 Sublingual & Buccal Routes

**Sublingual (SL)** and **buccal (Bucc)** formulations are designed for **rapid systemic absorption** via the **oral mucosa**. These dosage forms bypass the gastrointestinal tract and **first-pass hepatic metabolism**, delivering the drug **directly into the bloodstream** through **capillaries under or along the tongue and inner cheek**.

- **Sublingual (SL)**: Dosage form placed **under the tongue**, where it dissolves and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa.
- **Buccal (Bucc)**: Dosage form placed **between the cheek and gum**, where it dissolves and is absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Buccal forms may contain **bioadhesive polymers** to prolong retention time.

They are *useful* when **swallowing is impaired** or GI route is contraindicated and *suitable* for **emergency** or **onset-critical** drugs (e.g. nitroglycerin, fentanyl).

> 📌 These formulations are typically **solid** (e.g. tablets, films, wafers) or **liquid drops** (usually <1 mL per dose) containing **water-soluble drugs**.

#### ⚙️ Administration Guidelines

- If the mouth is **dry**, moisten it before administration to improve dissolution and absorption.
- **Do not chew or swallow** the dosage form; allow it to fully dissolve.
- **Avoid eating, drinking, or talking** until the drug is fully absorbed.
- Buccal forms with **mucoadhesives** can improve residence time and absorption but may feel bulky or uncomfortable.

#### 📉 Disadvantages

- **Unpleasant or bitter taste** is common.
- **Mucosal irritation** may occur.
- May be **inconvenient** for patients who cannot remain still or refrain from eating/drinking during administration.

### 🍑 Rectal Route

Drugs administered via the **rectal route** can provide **rapid, local or systemic,** effects. This route is used when:

- Local effects are desired (e.g. **Anti-inflammatory agents** to soothe **hemorrhoidal tissue** or **Laxatives** to stimulate bowel movements)
- Systemic effects are desired, but:
  - the drug is **unstable in gastric acid** or degraded by **digestive enzymes**
  - **Swallowing** is not feasible due to **nausea, vomiting, unconsciousness, or dysphagia**
  - Rapid absorption is needed but **parenteral routes** are not available

💊 **Common Rectal Formulations**

| Dosage Form | Description | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Suppositories** | Semisolid dosage forms that **melt or dissolve** at body temperature after insertion | Must be inserted past the anal sphincter for effectiveness |
| **Solutions (Enemas)** | Liquids administered rectally, used for **cleansing** or **retention** | Cleansing enemas (water-based) stimulate defecation; retention enemas (oil-based) soften stool |
| **Ointments** | Topical semisolids applied around the anus | Used for inflammation or irritation, often with local anesthetics or steroids |

> 🚨 **Frequent enema use is discouraged** due to potential for dependence and disruption of normal bowel function.

#### ⚠️ Disadvantages

- **Inconvenient and uncomfortable**
- **Erratic and unpredictable absorption**
- Risk of **expulsion** before the drug is fully absorbed
- May cause **local irritation**
