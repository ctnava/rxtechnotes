# üîë Key Medical Concepts

## üß† Nervous System

- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Transmits signals between the Central Nervous System and the body.
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Brain and spinal cord. Controls interpretation, decision-making, and motor initiation.
  - **Epilepsy**: Characterized by chronic, recurrent seizures.
  - **Bipolar Disorder**: Mood disorder with alternating episodes of mania and depression.
  - **Depression**: Affective disorder characterized by persistent low mood and anhedonia.
  - **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease**: Progressive neurodegenerative dementia with cognitive decline. May also involve peripheral nervous system markers.
  - **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease**: Progressive neuromuscular degeneration with motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity. Involves dopamine deficiency and may affect peripheral pathways.

## üå°Ô∏è Fevers & Pain

- **Antipyretic**: Drug that reduces fever (e.g., acetaminophen).
- **Opiate-type Analgesics (Narcotics)**: Pain-relief drugs derived from opium (e.g., morphine, codeine). High risk for dependence and abuse.
- **NSAIDs**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Provide analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., ibuprofen).
  - **Salicylates**: Subclass of NSAIDs; includes aspirin.
- **Local Anesthetics**: Block pain transmission along peripheral nerves without causing unconsciousness (e.g., cocaine, lidocaine).

## ü¶† Infections

- **Vaccine**: Stimulates immune response by exposing the body to a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen.
- **Antibiotic**: Targets and kills or inhibits bacteria.
- **Antiviral**: Inhibits viral replication (e.g., acyclovir).
- **Antifungal**: Inhibits growth of or kills fungi (e.g., fluconazole).

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiovascular System

- **Blood Pressure (BP)**: Force of circulating blood on arterial walls.
  - **Systolic BP (SBP)**: Pressure during heart contraction. **First number** in BP reading.
  - **Diastolic BP (DBP)**: Pressure during relaxation. **Second number** in BP reading.
- **Hypotension**: Low blood pressure.
  - **Vasopressors**: Increase blood pressure by vasoconstriction (e.g., norepinephrine).
- **Hypertension (HTN)**: Chronically elevated blood pressure.
  - **Vasodilators**: Relax and widen blood vessels (e.g., hydralazine).
  - **ACE Inhibitors**: typically end in `-pril`; lower BP by relaxing vessels (e.g., lisinopril).
  - **Beta Blockers**: typically end in `-lol`; Reduce heart rate and oxygen demand (e.g., metoprolol).
  - **Calcium Channel Blockers**: typically end in `-pine`; Slow cardiac conduction and relax vessels (e.g., amlodipine).
  - **Diuretics**: typically end in `-ide`Reduce blood volume to lower BP (e.g., furosemide).
  - **Antihyperlipidemics**: typically end in `-statin`; Lower blood lipids and cholesterol (e.g., statins).
  - **Antianginals**: Treat angina pectoris (chest pain due to ischemia).
- **Arrhythmia**: Irregular heart rhythm.
  - **Antiarrhythmics**: Medications that stabilize cardiac rhythm.
- **Thrombus**: Stationary blood clot in a vessel.
  - **Embolism**: Clot or other material that travels and obstructs blood flow.
  - **Anticoagulants**: Prevent clot formation (e.g., warfarin).
  - **Thrombolytics**: Dissolve existing blood clots (e.g., alteplase).

## üîÅ Hormonal Regulation

- **Corticosteroids**: Synthetic or natural hormones from adrenal cortex; suppress inflammation and immune response (e.g., prednisone).
- **Thyroid Disorders**:
  - **Hyperthyroidism**: Overproduction of thyroid hormones (e.g., Graves‚Äô disease).
  - **Hypothyroidism**: **Underproduction** of thyroid hormones (e.g., Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis).
- **Diabetes Mellitus**: Metabolic disorder involving improper insulin production or use.
  - **Insulin**: Pancreatic hormone that regulates blood glucose.

## ü¶¥ Musculoskeletal System

- **Gout**: Inflammatory arthritis caused by uric acid crystal accumulation in joints.
- **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Autoimmune disease causing chronic joint inflammation.
- **Osteoarthritis**: Degenerative joint disease from wear and tear; reduced mobility and deformity in weight-bearing joints.

## üçΩÔ∏è Gastrointestinal (GI) System

- **Antidiarrheals**: Slow intestinal motility or absorb excess fluid (e.g., loperamide).
- **Antiemetics**: Suppress nausea and vomiting (e.g., ondansetron).
- **Antacids**: Neutralize stomach acid (e.g., calcium carbonate).
- **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: Suppress acid production (e.g., omeprazole).
- **Stool Softeners**: Promote easier defecation by increasing water/fat in stool (e.g., docusate).

## üå¨Ô∏è Respiratory System

- **Asthma**: Chronic inflammation and narrowing of airways.
  - **Emphysema**: Chronic lung condition often associated with asthma and smoking.
- **Antihistamines**: Reduce allergy symptoms by blocking histamine (e.g., diphenhydramine).
- **Decongestants**: Shrink swollen (i.e. vasodilation) mucous membranes (e.g., pseudoephedrine).
- **Antitussives**: Suppress coughing (e.g., dextromethorphan).
- **Bronchodilators**: Relax bronchial muscles (i.e. bronchospasm) to improve airflow (e.g., albuterol).

## üßø Miscellaneous

- **Ophthalmic**: Formulations intended for use in the eye.
- **Anemia**: Decreased red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels, leading to reduced oxygen delivery.
