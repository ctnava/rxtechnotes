# 💊 Medication Safety Practices & Errors

**Medication safety** is crucial to reducing errors and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. Preventing medication errors is a core responsibility of every pharmacy team. Pharmacy technicians play a critical frontline role in identifying, preventing, and reporting potential errors before they reach the patient by ✅*adhering to proper procedures* and 👩‍⚕️*collaborating with pharmacists*.

## 🛡️ Medication Errors

According to the **National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting & Prevention (NCC MERP)**, **Medication Errors** are any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer.

**Medication errors** can result from breakdowns at multiple points in the medication-use system. Patient safety depends on accurate prescription processing and dispensing, for which the FDA, ISMP, and USP provide safety guidelines. Common medication errors include:

- ❌ **Prescribing Errors**: incorrect drug selection, dose, or instructions
- ✍️ **Transcription Errors**: data entry mistakes leading to incorrect labels
- 💊 **Dispensing Errors**: wrong medication, strength, or dosage form
- ⛔ **Administration Errors**: Incorrect patient instructions
- 👀 **Monitoring Errors**: Failure to detect interactions or reactions

Pharmacy technicians are often the final checkpoint before a medication reaches the patient. Their attention to detail and adherence to safety protocols make a significant difference in reducing preventable harm. Technicians should feel empowered to speak up if something seems wrong and to collaborate with pharmacists and prescribers to ensure patient safety.

## 🔢 Steps in the Medication-Use Process

Medication errors can happen at any point from prescribing to patient use. Understanding each step helps technicians identify where safeguards are needed. When similar errors appear in different settings, they often share common root causes. Identifying and addressing these shared vulnerabilities helps prevent future incidents.

### Prescribing & Order Communication

A licensed prescriber (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, dentist) selects and orders a medication based on the patient's diagnosis. Then, the prescription or medication order is transmitted from the prescriber to the pharmacy (or within a facility to the pharmacy or nursing unit).

**Potential Errors**:

- **Prescribing**
  - Wrong drug or dose chosen
  - Prescribing a drug the patient is allergic to
  - Omitting necessary details (e.g., route, frequency)
  - Illegible handwriting (on written scripts)
  - Prescribing despite known drug interactions
  - 🛡️ Technicians do not prescribe but may help identify potential allergies or duplicate therapies by reviewing patient profiles or alerting pharmacists. Educate yourself on high-alert medications and those with narrow therapeutic indexes.
- **Transcription**
  - Verbal orders misunderstood or misheard
  - Faxed or electronic orders routed incorrectly
  - Incomplete or ambiguous instructions
  - Errors in transcription or data entry
  - 🛡️ Technicians must verify and enter data accurately. Always clarify unclear orders with a pharmacist. Ask clarifying questions when a prescription seems unusual. Be especially careful when entering verbal or handwritten prescriptions.

> 🛡️ **The NCCMERP Recommends that**:
>
> - patient profiles be current and contain adequate clinical information for the pharmacist to assess appropriateness of orders.
> - the pharmacist always review presciptions & orders. Any incomplete, illegible, or otherwise concerning orders should be clarified.
