# 💊 Medication Safety Practices & Errors

**Medication safety** is crucial to reducing errors and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. Preventing medication errors is a core responsibility of every pharmacy team. Pharmacy technicians play a critical frontline role in identifying, preventing, and reporting potential errors before they reach the patient by ✅*adhering to proper procedures* and 👩‍⚕️*collaborating with pharmacists*.

## 🛡️ Medication Errors

According to the **National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting & Prevention (NCC MERP)**, **Medication Errors** are any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer.

**Medication errors** can result from breakdowns at multiple points in the medication-use system. Patient safety depends on accurate prescription processing and dispensing, for which the FDA, ISMP, and USP provide safety guidelines. Common medication errors include:

- ❌ **Prescribing Errors**: incorrect drug selection, dose, or instructions
- ✍️ **Transcription Errors**: data entry mistakes leading to incorrect labels
- 💊 **Dispensing Errors**: wrong medication, strength, or dosage form
- ⛔ **Administration Errors**: Incorrect patient instructions
- 👀 **Monitoring Errors**: Failure to detect interactions or reactions

Pharmacy technicians are often the final checkpoint before a medication reaches the patient. Their attention to detail and adherence to safety protocols make a significant difference in reducing preventable harm. Technicians should feel empowered to speak up if something seems wrong and to collaborate with pharmacists and prescribers to ensure patient safety.
