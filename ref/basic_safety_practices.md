# 💊 Medication Safety Practices & Errors

**Medication safety** is crucial to reducing errors and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. Preventing medication errors is a core responsibility of every pharmacy team. Pharmacy technicians play a critical frontline role in identifying, preventing, and reporting potential errors before they reach the patient by ✅*adhering to proper procedures* and 👩‍⚕️*collaborating with pharmacists*.

## 🛡️ Medication Errors

According to the **National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting & Prevention (NCC MERP)**, **Medication Errors** are any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer.

**Medication errors** can result from breakdowns at multiple points in the medication-use system. Patient safety depends on accurate prescription processing and dispensing, for which the FDA, ISMP, and USP provide safety guidelines. Common medication errors include:

- ❌ **Prescribing Errors**: incorrect drug selection, dose, or instructions
- ✍️ **Transcription Errors**: data entry mistakes leading to incorrect labels
- 💊 **Dispensing Errors**: wrong medication, strength, or dosage form
- ⛔ **Administration Errors**: Incorrect patient instructions
- 👀 **Monitoring Errors**: Failure to detect interactions or reactions

Pharmacy technicians are often the final checkpoint before a medication reaches the patient. Their attention to detail and adherence to safety protocols make a significant difference in reducing preventable harm. Technicians should feel empowered to speak up if something seems wrong and to collaborate with pharmacists and prescribers to ensure patient safety.

## 🔢 Steps in the Medication-Use Process

Medication errors can happen at any point from prescribing to patient use. Understanding each step helps technicians identify where safeguards are needed. When similar errors appear in different settings, they often share common root causes. Identifying and addressing these shared vulnerabilities helps prevent future incidents.

### 1. Prescribing & Order Communication

A licensed prescriber (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, dentist) selects and orders a medication based on the patient's diagnosis. Then, the prescription or medication order is transmitted from the prescriber to the pharmacy (or within a facility to the pharmacy or nursing unit).

**Potential Errors**:

- **Prescribing**
  - Wrong drug or dose chosen
  - Prescribing a drug the patient is allergic to
  - Omitting necessary details (e.g., route, frequency)
  - Illegible handwriting (on written scripts)
  - Prescribing despite known drug interactions
  - 🛡️ Technicians do not prescribe but may help identify potential allergies or duplicate therapies by reviewing patient profiles or alerting pharmacists. Educate yourself on high-alert medications and those with narrow therapeutic indexes.
- **Transcription**
  - Verbal orders misunderstood or misheard
  - Faxed or electronic orders routed incorrectly
  - Incomplete or ambiguous instructions
  - Errors in transcription or data entry
  - 🛡️ Technicians must verify and enter data accurately. Always clarify unclear orders with a pharmacist. Ask clarifying questions when a prescription seems unusual. Be especially careful when entering verbal or handwritten prescriptions.

> 🛡️ **The NCCMERP Recommends that**:
>
> - patient profiles be current and contain adequate clinical information for the pharmacist to assess appropriateness of orders.
> - the pharmacist always review presciptions & orders. Any incomplete, illegible, or otherwise concerning orders should be clarified.

### 2. Product Preparation, Labeling, & Packaging

If compounding is required, a medication is prepared by mixing, measuring, or reconstituting ingredients into a patient-specific formulation. Otherwise, readily available dosage forms are gathered from stock shelves.

From here, labels are printed or written for the final medication container dispensed to the patient or caregiver and then medications are placed into containers (e.g., vials, unit-dose packs, blister cards) for dispensing.

**Potential Errors**:

- **Compounding**
  - Wrong ingredients or concentrations
  - Incorrect calculations
  - Contamination
  - 🛡️ Double-check calculations and measurements. Follow sterile or non-sterile compounding protocols exactly. Label everything immediately.
- **Product Selection**
  - Confusion between drugs with similar names (e.g., **clonidine** vs. **klonopin**)
  - Using abbreviations or shorthand that can be misread
  - 🛡️ Use Tall Man Lettering, barcode scanning, and avoid dangerous abbreviations. Be cautious with look-alike/sound-alike drugs.
- **Labeling**
  - Providing incorrect directions on the label
  - Incorrect patient name
  - Missing auxiliary labels
  - Wrong drug or strength on label
  - 🛡️ Ensure printed labels match the original prescription. Check that auxiliary labels are appropriate and included.
- **Packaging**
  - Placing the wrong drug in the right-labeled bottle
  - Mixing up similar-looking tablets
  - Reusing containers with leftover labels
  - 🛡️ Verify drug, strength, and dosage form when filling. Do not use containers with old or partially removed labels. Double-check **National Drug Code (NDC)** during product selection.

> 🛡️ **The NCCMERP Recommends that**:
>
> - adequate staffing and resources should be present for the workload expected.
> - product inventory should be arranged and separated to help differentiate medications; including visual discriminators.
> - a series of checks should be established to assess the accuracy of the dispensing process. Other methods of checking include automation, computers, & patient profiles.
> - labels should be read at least 3 times, on product selection, packaging, & return.
> - staff triple check replenishment of regular stock or automated dispencers to ensure accuracy and precision.

### 3. Dispensing, Education, & Distribution

The final check is performed and medication is prepared for release to the patient or caregiver and they are informed about how to take their medication safely and what to expect. Alternatively, medication is transferred from the pharmacy to the patient or, in institutions, to the correct nursing unit or automated dispensing cabinet.

**Potential Errors**:

- **Dispensing**
  - Dispensing the **wrong drug**
  - Dispensing the **correct drug but in the wrong strength**
  - Mismatching patient profile and prescription
  - Omission of counseling or warnings
  - 🛡️ Barcode scan the medication. Verify patient information. Ensure pharmacist verification and patient counseling, where required.
- **Education**
  - Misunderstood directions
  - Lack of knowledge about side effects
  - Failure to recognize when to seek help
  - 🛡️ Provide written materials, ensure the pharmacist is consulted when needed, and verify patient has understood any special instructions.
- **Distribution**
  - Sending medication to the wrong location
  - Failure to maintain cold chain (for refrigerated meds)
  - Missing doses in automated cabinets
  - 🛡️ Match location/patient identifiers carefully. Monitor storage conditions. Restock automation correctly.

> 🛡️ **The NCCMERP Recommends that**:
>
> - the dispensing area be properly designed to prevent errors; addressing environmental fatigue, minimize distractions, and personnel interruptions. Keep workstations **organized and distraction-free** to reduce the chance of error.
> - pharmacists counsel patients at time of dispensing to verify accuracy & patient understanding. Counseling should include explanations of:
>   - indications for use, precautions, and warnings
>   - expected outcome from use
>   - potential adverse reactions, as well as interactions from food and other medications
>   - steps to take when adverse reactions or interactions occur
>   - storage requirements

### 4. Administration, Use, & Monitoring

Afterwards, the medication is actually given to the patient by a healthcare professional. Alternatively, the patient takes the medication as intended (or not).

The patient’s response to therapy is also assessed to determine if adjustments are needed.

- **Administration**
  - Wrong patient, drug, time, route, or dose
  - Omission of required dose
  - Giving medication despite contraindications
  - 🛡️ In outpatient settings, confirm patient understanding during pick-up. In institutional settings, support administration by restocking and flagging issues.
- **Use**
  - Non-adherence or incorrect use
  - Sharing medications
  - Taking expired or improperly stored medications
  - 🛡️ Help patients understand timing, storage, and use. Encourage compliance and refer to pharmacist when issues arise.
- **Monitoring**
  - Overlooking adverse reactions
  - Failing to detect lack of effectiveness
  - Ignoring lab results
  - 🛡️ Assist with refill histories, note adverse event reports, and flag refills that may indicate inappropriate or ineffective therapy.

> 🛡️ **The NCCMERP Recommends that**:
>
> - pharmacies collect and analysze data regarding actual and potential errors for continuous quality improvement
> - initial and ongoing training of staff must be provided
> - each pharmacy establish policies and procedures for the dispensing process
