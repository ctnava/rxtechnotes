# Public Healthcare

## Medicare & Medicaid

The ***Social Security Act Amendments (1965)*** created the Medicare and Medicaid programs:

- **Medicaid**: A joint federal-state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals; operating as HMOs.
- **Medicare**: A federal health insurance program for people aged 65+, individuals with certain disabilities, and patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); operating as HMOs unless the customer elects to enroll in Medicare Part C where it may act as an HMO or PPO offered by private insurers.

These programs laid the foundation for future pharmacy regulations that affect how medications are dispensed and monitored, especially for public health insurance recipients.

| Part | Nickname | üìù What It Covers | üí∞ Costs | üíä Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| üÖ∞Ô∏è   | Hospital Insurance | Inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing, hospice, home health | Usually "free" if worked 10+ years (payroll taxes) | Deductibles & coinsurance apply |
| üÖ±Ô∏è   | Medical Insurance  | Doctor visits, outpatient services, preventive care, DME | Monthly premium, deductible,  20% coinsurance after deductible, unless supplemental coverage (e.g., Medigap) applies | Optional; Penalty applies if not enrolled when first eligible and not covered by other creditable drug coverage. |
| üÖ≤   | Medicare Advantage | Combines A & B (and usually D), run by private insurers | Varies by plan | May offer dental, vision, hearing, gym |
| üÖ≥   | Prescription Drug | Outpatient prescription drugs | Monthly premium, deductible, copays | Private plans available; penalty for late enrollment; Established by the MMA (2003) |

> ü§Ø The ***Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, 2010)*** was signed into law with the overall goals of improving patient care, quality, and outcomes while reducing cost.

### üç© The Medicare Part D ‚ÄúDonut Hole‚Äù (Coverage Gap)

The ‚Äúdonut hole‚Äù is a temporary limit on what Medicare Part D will pay for prescription drugs.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Deductible Phase** | You pay 100% until your deductible is met (if plan has one).                                                                    |
| üí∏ **Initial Coverage** | You pay a **copay/coinsurance**; plan pays the rest. Ends when total drug costs (you + plan) hit a threshold (e.g., \~\$5,030). |
| üç© **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")** | You pay no more than 25% of the cost for brand-name and generic drugs during the gap (discounts are applied due to manufacturer contributions). |
| üíØ **Catastrophic Coverage** | After your out-of-pocket costs hit the cap (\~\$8,000), you pay **nothing** or a small coinsurance per prescription. |

> üíä For techs: Patients in the donut hole may suddenly pay more‚Äîwatch for confusion or frustration and refer to the pharmacist.

## üè• Medi-Cal (California Medicaid)

Medi-Cal is California‚Äôs Medicaid program, providing free or low-cost health coverage for:

- Low-income families and individuals
- Seniors (65+)
- People with disabilities
- Certain adults under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

It covers a wide range of services like doctor visits, hospital care, mental health, vision, dental, and prescriptions.

> üíä Pharmacy Tech Tip: Medi-Cal often uses a state drug formulary and may require Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) for non-preferred or high-cost medications, especially those not on the state‚Äôs formulary.

### ü©∫ Medi-Medi (Dual Eligibility)

A ‚ÄúMedi-Medi‚Äù patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal.

Medicare is the primary payer; Medi-Cal acts as secondary, covering:

- Co-pays
- Deductibles
- Coinsurance
- These patients often qualify for extra help with Part D prescription drug costs.

> üß† Watch for ‚ÄúMedi-Medi‚Äù flags in patient profiles. These patients usually have no out-of-pocket cost for covered meds and medical care.

## ü¶æ Veterans Health Coverage: VA, TRICARE, & CHAMPVA

In addition to private and public insurance plans, some patients receive prescription drug coverage through programs specifically for military personnel, veterans, and their families. These programs include VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA. Each has unique eligibility rules, formularies, and pharmacy networks.

### üá∫üá∏ VA (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)

The VA provides healthcare (including prescriptions) to eligible veterans through VA medical facilities.

- Prescriptions are typically filled at **VA pharmacies** or via VA mail-order.
- The VA has its own **national formulary**, and medications must be prescribed by a **VA provider** to be covered.
- Outside pharmacies generally cannot bill the VA unless under special arrangements.
- Copayments are based on priority group, income level, and whether the condition is service-connected.

> üíä **Tech Tip**: If a patient brings a VA prescription to a retail pharmacy, it likely won‚Äôt be covered‚Äîrefer them back to the VA system unless there‚Äôs a special authorization.

### üî∫ TRICARE

TRICARE is the healthcare program for:

- Active-duty military members
- Retirees
- National Guard/Reserve members
- Their dependents

TRICARE is managed by the **Department of Defense (DoD)** and offers several plan types, including **TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life** (for Medicare-eligible retirees).

Pharmacy Benefits:

- Managed by Express Scripts.
- Covers prescriptions from:
  - Military treatment facility pharmacies (no copay)
  - TRICARE retail network pharmacies (small copay)
  - Mail-order pharmacy through **Express Scripts Home Delivery** is usually the cheapest for maintenance medications.
  - Formularies are tiered, and prior authorizations may be required for certain drugs.

> üìã **Tech Tip**: Always check if the pharmacy is in-network for TRICARE. Verify eligibility using the patient‚Äôs military ID or DoD Benefits Number (DBN).

### ü©∫ CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs)

CHAMPVA provides coverage for spouses and dependent children of veterans who:

- Are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected condition, or
- Died as a result of a service-connected condition.

CHAMPVA is not the same as TRICARE, but similar in how it functions.

Key Points:

- CHAMPVA covers prescriptions filled at rtail pharmacies; patients who are Medicare-eligible must enroll in Part D to receive outpatient prescription coverage through CHAMPVA.
- Claims may need to be **submitted manually** if the pharmacy isn‚Äôt set up for electronic CHAMPVA billing.
- CHAMPVA may act as **secondary insurance** if the patient has another plan.

> üß† **Tech Tip**: CHAMPVA patients may carry a special ID card. Verify the plan and check reimbursement procedures. CHAMPVA doesn‚Äôt always process like standard insurance.

| Program | Who It Covers | Where Prescriptions Are Filled | Notes |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----- |
| **VA** | Enrolled veterans | VA pharmacies or mail-order | Must use VA providers; no outside retail coverage without preapproval |
| **TRICARE** | Military (active, retired), dependents | Military pharmacies, retail network, mail-order | Express Scripts manages pharmacy benefits |
| **CHAMPVA** | Dependents of disabled/deceased veterans | Retail pharmacies, Medicare Part D (if eligible) | May require manual claim submission; differs from TRICARE |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always verify insurance details for military and veteran patients‚Äîcoverage rules and pharmacy networks vary significantly between VA, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA.
