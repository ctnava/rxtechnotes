Pharmacy technicians are the backbone of daily pharmacy operations. They work under the supervision and control of licensed pharmacists to ensure that prescriptions are accurately prepared, labeled, and dispensed.

- 🏔️ **Unlicensed Personnel** – Colorado  
- 🏛️ **Ancillary Personnel** – District of Columbia  
- 🌾 **Pharmaceutical Technicians** – North Dakota
