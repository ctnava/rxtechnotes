## Introduction & Disclaimer

In light of a recent executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, the Executive Office of the President of the United States published the article **‚ÄúKeeping Education Accessible and Ending Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates in Schools‚Äù** on **February 13, 2025**, to relay the order‚Äôs contents.

To justify the order, Trump et al. cite alarming trends including rising obesity, diabetes, mental illness, and autoimmune conditions. These are described as contributors to high healthcare costs and national security risks. While US government website content is currently subject to arbitrary change and security vulnerabilities, the document was available at the White House website as of **February 17, 2025**. The following summary reflects the contents available on that date.

## Summary

The executive order establishes the **Make America Healthy Again Commission** with a special focus on **chronic disease** and **childhood health issues**. The commission functions in an advisory capacity and has no regulatory power. Its duties are limited to **research, recommendations, and reporting**.

### Timeline and Deliverables

- **Within 100 days**:  
  The commission must deliver a report detailing:
  - The state of childhood chronic disease in the United States  
  - Speculative, contributing factors including medication, food additives, chemicals, and environmental exposures  

  This report acts as a **Drug Utilization Review (DUR)** for American youth, to be conducted by unnamed members of a **Political Action Committee (PAC)**.

- **Within 180 days**:  
  The commission must propose a **national health strategy**, including:
  - A plan to restructure federal health efforts  
  - Implementation strategies for effective solutions  

  After submission, the commission may recommend further actions or be reconvened for follow-up directives. However, the scope and structure imply that it may become inactive after initial reporting.

## Conclusions

The executive order appears to have an **unspoken goal**: increasing **military enlistment eligibility** by reducing disqualifying psychiatric diagnoses and limiting long-term medication use.

While publicly framed as a health initiative, the focus on **chronic disease and mental health** suggests concerns about **military readiness**, especially given that **77% of young adults are ineligible for service**, often due to health-related disqualifiers.

The order implies skepticism of psychiatric medications such as:

- SSRIs  
- Antipsychotics  
- Stimulants  

Stricter diagnostic criteria may reduce the number of individuals labeled with disqualifying conditions, thereby increasing the eligible enlistment pool. However, this also risks:

- Restricting access to essential mental health care  
- Exacerbating existing **military suicide rates**, which are already the **leading cause of death among US service members**

The military already suffers from significant **mental health stigma**, and reduced early intervention could deepen this crisis. If the priority is enlistment numbers over medical care, long-term **public health** and **national security** may both suffer.
