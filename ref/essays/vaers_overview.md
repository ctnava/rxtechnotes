# Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Overview

The **U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS)** established the **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)** in **1990** as a national surveillance system to detect potential safety concerns related to **U.S.-licensed vaccines**[^1]. It is a joint effort between the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** and the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** to monitor vaccine safety and respond to emerging risks[^4].

VAERS is a **passive surveillance system**, which means it relies on **voluntary reports** submitted by:

- Patients  
- Parents and caregivers  
- Healthcare providers (HCPs)  
- Vaccine manufacturers  

These reports help identify unusual or unexpected patterns of **adverse events following vaccination**[^1].

## Historical Context

VAERS was designed to streamline and enhance earlier systems:

- **CDC‚Äôs Monitoring System for Adverse Events Following Immunization (MSAEFI)**  
- **FDA‚Äôs Spontaneous Reporting System**[^5]

Both systems supported the **National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986**, which mandates that HCPs and vaccine manufacturers report vaccine-related adverse events[^4]. By consolidating these programs, VAERS:

- Improved data accessibility  
- Facilitated compliance with federal reporting laws  
- Strengthened vaccine safety monitoring infrastructure  

## Limitations

Despite its importance, VAERS has several inherent limitations:

- **Underreporting**: Not all adverse events are documented[^3]  
- **Data variability**: Reports vary in quality and completeness because submissions are accepted from anyone[^3]  
- **Lack of causality**: Reports are not proof that the vaccine caused the event. VAERS is designed to identify **safety signals**, not to confirm causation[^3]

## Role of Pharmacy Professionals

Pharmacists and other HCPs are required under **NCVIA** to report any **known or suspected adverse vaccine reactions**. Pharmacy technicians may be tasked with filing these reports on a pharmacist‚Äôs behalf[^5].

### Reporting Process

To submit a report:

1. Visit [vaers.hhs.gov](https://vaers.hhs.gov)
2. Click **‚ÄúReport an Adverse Event‚Äù**[^2]
3. Collect the necessary information:
   - **Patient demographics** (e.g., age, sex, date of birth)  
   - **Vaccine details** (e.g., brand name, dosage)  
   - Any relevant health history or outcome data  
4. Choose a submission method:
   - **Online portal** (guided step-by-step entry)  
   - **Offline PDF form** (download, complete, and upload manually)[^2]

## Conclusion

VAERS is a vital component of the U.S. public health system, enabling early detection of potential vaccine safety issues. As a **future pharmacy technician**, I understand that my participation in reporting, however small, plays a crucial role in:

- Supporting public health
- Ensuring vaccine safety
- Upholding the integrity of national surveillance data

By contributing accurate and timely reports, I help safeguard both individual patients and the broader community.
