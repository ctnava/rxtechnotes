# Pharmacy Inventory Management

Pharmacy inventory management ensures medications and supplies are available **in the right quantities, at the right time, and in suitable conditions** to support safe, efficient patient care. Proper systems reduce waste, lower costs, prevent shortages or overstocking, and ensure **regulatory compliance** through accurate tracking and documentation.

> ✅ Applies to all pharmacy personnel involved in procurement, storage, handling, and recordkeeping.

Pharmacy inventory includes:

- Prescription medications
- 💸 Over-the-counter (OTC) products
- 🔐 Controlled substances
- General pharmacy supplies (e.g., vials, labels, PPE)
- 📍 Durable and nondurable medical equipment dispensed with prescriptions

## 👤 Personnel Involved

- **Pharmacist-in-Charge (PIC)**:
  - Oversees inventory policies and procedures
  - Ensures compliance with federal and state laws
  - Approves final audits and discrepancy resolutions

- **Pharmacy Technicians**:
  - Perform daily inventory functions (stocking, returns, expiration checks)
  - Alert pharmacists to discrepancies or shortages
  - Monitor and maintain stock levels

- **Inventory Coordinator** (if assigned):
  - Manages order placements, receiving, and returns
  - Resolves shipment or record mismatches
  - Coordinates inventory cycle counts and physical audits

> 🔐 Controlled substances require additional documentation, restricted access, and secure storage per DEA and state board regulations.  
> See: 🔗 [CSA/CMEA Broad Overview](./law/csa_cmea.md)

## 🔑 Inventory Concepts

- **Turnover Rate**  
  - How long inventory sits on the shelf before being used or sold  
  - 📌 **High turnover** = efficient inventory; **Low turnover** = potential waste or poor selection
- **PAR Levels (Periodic Automatic Replenishment)**  
  - Minimum stock thresholds that trigger reorder  
  - Prevents stockouts and overstocking

Pharmacy technicians help ensure the pharmacy is well-stocked without over-ordering.

- Be familiar with **high-demand medications** (e.g., common antihypertensives) and ensure adequate inventory
- **Low-demand items** do not require large quantities and may be special ordered when needed
- Many pharmacies use **automated inventory systems**, but technicians may manually place orders for out-of-stock or special items
- Communicate **shortages or backorders** to the pharmacist or supervisor

> - 🛡️ Always report shortages to PIC or coordinator
> - 🔄 Restocking should be proactive—anticipate needs based on trends and upcoming holidays or flu season.

### 🗃️ Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual Inventory System**
  - Maintains a **real-time record** of inventory by updating whenever medications are received or dispensed when automated systems are properly integrated
    - Enables accurate audits at any point
  - 🔐 Required for **controlled substances (Schedules II–V)**; logging of usage and receipts
  - Generates automatic reorders based on **PAR levels**.
    - Manual orders may be entered.

- **Point of Sale (POS) System**
  - Deducts items from inventory **at the time of sale or dispensing**.
  - Helps in real-time tracking of stock levels through integration with pharmacy inventory management software.

- **Automated Dispensing Systems (ADS)**
  - Use **computerized cabinets or robotics** to manage inventory in institutional settings.
  - Improves accuracy, reduces diversion, and speeds up the dispensing process.
  - Often integrated with pharmacy inventory management software.

## 📅 Inventory Counting & Audits

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Inventory Counting & Discrepancy Reporting SOP Document Link -->

### Initial Inventory

- Conducted before opening a new pharmacy or adding controlled substances to stock

### Cycle Counting

- Ongoing partial counts of inventory segments
- Used to detect loss or discrepancies in real time

### 🔐🦅 Biennial Inventory

- Required every 2 years under DEA rules
- Full controlled substance inventory by actual physical count
- 🛡️ Signed and dated by PIC; Often required by many state boards or employers

### Annual Physical Inventory

- Full inventory count of all medications and supplies
- Often required by company SOPs or state boards

### ⚠️ Discrepancy Reporting

- All inventory discrepancies must be:
  - **Documented promptly**
  - **Investigated thoroughly**
  - **Resolved with corrective actions**
- 🔐 `DEA Form 106` is required if loss or theft of controlled substances is confirmed

> 🛡️ Maintain accurate records to protect your license and ensure audit readiness.

## 💰 Provisioning

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Ordering SOP Document Link -->

Pharmacies provision stock from state-licensed:

- **Suppliers**: produce, label, and package drugs
- **Wholesalers**: purchase drugs in bulk and then sell them to medical facilities

> 🔐 `DEA Form 222` is required for ordering Schedule II drugs via CSOS.
> 🦅x🔐 FDA and DEA registration is also required for controlled substances.
> 🦅 See the 🔗 [PDMA](./law/fda_fdca.md#prescription-drug-marketing-act-pdma-1987) for regulations on manufacturer & wholesaler activities.

### 🏭 Suppliers

There are 3 main types of supplier: drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, and compounding pharmacies. All of them order raw materials or finished goods (like (in)active ingredients) to produce their goods. However, each one exists for a different scale of care.

- **Drug Manufacturers** package medication in standard dosage forms for mass distribution
- **Specialty Pharmacies** focus on providing high-cost, complex medications and specialized services to patients with chronic conditions
- **Compounding Pharmacies** customize medications on a patient-specific basis, often mixing, combining, or altering existing drugs to meet individual needs

> 🦅 [340B](./law/healthcare.md#-public-health-service-act-phsa-1944-340b-in-1992) limits the cost safety-net providers, like medicaid, federally qualified health centers, and qualified hospitals paid for outpatient drugs through wholesalers.

### 🚚 Wholesalers

Wholesalers create regional and national distribution networks, storing bulk purchases in strategically placed warehouses to enable 24–48 hour delivery. They also drop ship lower-volume, high-cost medications on an as-needed basis.

### 🖐 Receiving

When receiving a shipment, **verify contents immediately and accurately** against the **Purchase Order (PO)** and invoice to ensure the correct items, quantities, and prices have been delivered.

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Shipment Receiving SOP Document Link -->

Pharmacy technicians must:

- ✅ **Check product name, strength, dosage form, and quantity** for each item.
- ✅ **Compare prices** listed on the invoice with those agreed upon in the PO.
- ✅ **Inspect for damage**, contamination, expiration, or tampering. Return unacceptable stock to the supplier or wholesaler.
- ✅ **Report and log all discrepancies** (e.g., wrong drug, short shipment, overages) **immediately** per facility SOP.
- ✅ **Sign and date invoices** upon receipt to confirm delivery.
- ✅ **Enter received stock into the inventory system**, including lot numbers and expiration dates if required.
- ✅ **Store medications according to manufacturer specifications**, including immediate refrigeration or freezing when required.

> 📍x🔐 **Schedule II controlled substances (C-II)** are shipped **separately** from all other medications and must be:
>
> - **Checked in** by authorized personnel only  
> - **Logged** into the perpetual inventory system immediately  
> - **Stored** in a DEA-compliant secured location  
> - Documented per federal and state requirements
>
> 🛡️ Retain all receiving documents for recordkeeping and future audits. Ensure chain-of-custody documentation is maintained, especially for controlled substances.

## 📁 Storage

Proper storage of medications ensures **potency, safety, and compliance** with federal and state regulations. Poor storage practices can lead to contamination, degradation, or diversion. Pharmacy technicians play a key role in maintaining clean, organized, and legally compliant storage environments which typically looks like this:

- 📚 Organized shelving, cabinets, or drawers
- 🔐 C-II controlled substances must be kept in **locked storage**
- 💊 C-III through C-V medications may be kept on open shelves
- ❄️ Pharmacy refrigerators must be **drug-only** (no food or drink allowed)

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Always stock **older inventory in front** of newer stock so that the earliest expiration dates are used first. This reduces the chance of medications expiring on the shelf.
- **LASA Medications (Look-Alike, Sound-Alike)**: Must be **separated**, flagged with warning stickers, or labeled using **Tall Man Lettering** (e.g., `predniSONE` vs. `prednisoLONE`). Storing these on **separate shelves or tiers** further reduces risk of dispensing errors.
- **Mylars**: Used to identify **hazardous drugs** (☣️). These labels should be placed clearly on shelves and packaging. Extra precautions should be followed when handling.
- **Store by Dosage Form & Sort by Strength**:
  - Organize shelves **first by dosage form** (e.g., tablets, capsules, liquids, injectables).
  - Then, sort each dosage form **by strength**, from **lowest to highest**.
  - This prevents mix-ups and ensures faster, safer dispensing workflow.

### 🗂️ Special Storage Locations

- **Fast Mover Shelf**: Roughly 20% of medications account for 80% of dispensing volume. These high-demand items are kept on a dedicated shelf for **quick access**. Always check if new stock belongs here before shelving elsewhere.
- **Unit of Use Shelf**: Designated for **unit-dose packaging** (single doses) or **unit-of-use packs** (e.g., a 10-day antibiotic course). Keeps bulk items separated from pre-counted or therapy-based packaging.
- **ALPHA Shelves**: Low-demand inventory (the remaining 80%) is organized **alphabetically** by generic name unless otherwise directed.
- **Negative Pressure Isolation Room**: Used for storage of **radioactive**, **cytotoxic**, or other **hazardous substances**. These rooms prevent hazardous vapors from escaping into surrounding areas.
- 🔐 **CII Inventory Safe**: Schedule II medications must be stored in a **secure, locked cabinet or safe**, accessible only by authorized personnel per DEA regulations (🦅x🔐).

> 🛡️ **Always check Fast Mover and Unit of Use shelves first** before placing items on ALPHA shelves.

### 🌡️ USP Storage Temperature Guidelines

| Storage Type           | Temperature Range                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Freezer** | –25°C to –10°C (–13°F to 14°F) |
| **Refrigerated** | 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) |
| **Controlled Room Temp** | 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) |
| **Excessive Heat** | > 40°C (> 104°F) |

> 📍 *Temperatures must be checked and logged **daily**. Any out-of-range readings should be reported to the pharmacist-in-charge immediately and documented according to facility SOP.*

### 🏥 Floor Stock (Hospitals)

- Medications stored outside the central pharmacy, typically on **nursing units** for immediate patient use.
- Includes **frequently used items**, such as PRN pain relievers, antacids, or emergency medications.
- Must be **monitored, replenished, and audited regularly**.
- Controlled substances in floor stock require **additional tracking and documentation** per DEA and institutional policies (🦅x🔐).

### 🛍️ Other Supplies

Technicians & Pharmacy Clerks are responsible for restocking commonly used pharmacy supplies, including:

- 💊 Prescription vials, lids, and bottles (various sizes)
- 🏷️ Prescription labels and auxiliary sticker rolls
- 🧻 Printer paper and **receipt rolls** for the cash register
- 🛍️ Prescription bags for pickups and deliveries

> 🔁 Supplies should be checked at the **start and end of each shift** or according to pharmacy policy.

## 🧹 Maintenance

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for routinely (e.g., weekly or monthly) checking inventory for medications that are **no longer eligible for dispensing**. These medications must be promptly **removed from active stock**, **clearly labeled**, and **accurately documented** to prevent errors, diversion, or legal noncompliance.

> ✅ Applies to all technicians responsible for inventory checks, stock rotation, and returns.

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Inventory Maintenance SOP Document Link -->

### ⏰ Routine Inspections

Medications ineligible for dispensing or distribution include:

- **Damaged Stock**: Sensitive items with broken seals (e.g. opened NitroStat vials), crushed tablets, illegible packaging, visible contamination, or signs of improper storage (e.g., water damage, temperature excursion).
- **Expired Stock**: Products past their labeled expiration date, typically listed as `YYYY/MM`. These are valid **through the last day of the month** unless marked with a full `MM/DD/YYYY` date.
  - **Within 6 months of expiration**: Apply a **"short-dated" label**; may remain available for dispensing with priority rotation.
  - **Within 3 months of expiration**: **Pull** from saleable inventory and transfer to quarantine area for return or disposal.
- **Discontinued Medications**: Medications no longer manufactured or distributed. Includes products withdrawn for safety reasons or replaced with updated formulations.
- **Recalled Medications**: Subject to a manufacturer or FDA-initiated recall due to safety, efficacy, or compliance issues. Must be removed immediately upon notice.
  - <!-- Todo: 🔗 FDA Recalls Document Link -->
  - **Class I**: Reasonable probability of serious health consequences or death (e.g., mislabeling, contamination).
  - **Class II**: Temporary or reversible medical harm (e.g., potency variations).
  - **Class III**: Not likely to cause harm but violates FDA labeling or manufacturing standards.

> 📍 All ineligible medications must be stored in a **clearly marked, visually distinct, physically separated area** (e.g., “Do Not Dispense,” “Quarantine Bin”) and recorded in inventory logs.
> 🔐 Controlled substances must be **tracked, segregated, and secured** under DEA regulations when awaiting return or destruction.

### 🚮 Waste Management

Proper waste handling ensures patient privacy and environmental responsibility.

- 🗑️ **Regular Trash**: Must be removed daily or per facility policy
- ♻️ **Drug Bottles**: Empty stock bottles are often separated for recycling
- 🔐 **Protected Health Information (PHI)** (also called **DPI**, or "data protected information") must be:
  - Placed in secure bins labeled for shredding
  - Picked up and destroyed by a contracted vendor that complies with HIPAA (1996)

> ⚖️ Mishandling PHI is a serious HIPAA violation and can result in fines or disciplinary action.

#### 🗑️ Reverse Distribution

**Reverse distributors** are **DEA-registered third parties** authorized to handle the return and destruction of pharmaceuticals. They process:

- **Expired**
- **Damaged**
- **Discontinued**
- **Recalled**
- **Unwanted controlled substances**

Pharmacy technicians must:

- **Sort** medications into:
  - **Returnable items** (eligible for credit or replacement)
  - **Non-returnable items** (must be destroyed)
- **Document** all items in reverse distribution logs, including quantity, lot number, expiration date, and reason for removal.
- **Package** inventory securely for shipment, following all handling and labeling protocols.
- 🔐 **Controlled Substances**:
  - Destruction must be documented using `DEA Form 41`
  - Reverse Distribution of Schedule II medication must be documented using `DEA Form 222`
  - Return to a reverse distributor must maintain **chain-of-custody**
  - Disposal on-site (rare) must be **witnessed** and logged per DEA and state board requirements

> 🛡️ Follow all facility SOPs, manufacturer instructions, and reverse distributor protocols.  
> 🛡️ Always maintain complete records of returned or destroyed products in case of audit or diversion investigation.
