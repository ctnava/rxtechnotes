# Pharmacy Inventory Management

Pharmacy inventory management ensures medications and supplies are available **in the right quantities, at the right time, and in suitable conditions** to support safe, efficient patient care. Proper systems reduce waste, lower costs, prevent shortages or overstocking, and ensure **regulatory compliance** through accurate tracking and documentation.

> ✅ Applies to all pharmacy personnel involved in procurement, storage, handling, and recordkeeping.

Pharmacy inventory includes:

- Prescription medications
- 💸 Over-the-counter (OTC) products
- 🔐 Controlled substances
- General pharmacy supplies (e.g., vials, labels, PPE)
- 📍 Durable and nondurable medical equipment dispensed with prescriptions

## 👤 Personnel Involved

- **Pharmacist-in-Charge (PIC)**:
  - Oversees inventory policies and procedures
  - Ensures compliance with federal and state laws
  - Approves final audits and discrepancy resolutions

- **Pharmacy Technicians**:
  - Perform daily inventory functions (stocking, returns, expiration checks)
  - Alert pharmacists to discrepancies or shortages
  - Monitor and maintain stock levels

- **Inventory Coordinator** (if assigned):
  - Manages order placements, receiving, and returns
  - Resolves shipment or record mismatches
  - Coordinates inventory cycle counts and physical audits

> 🔐 Controlled substances require additional documentation, restricted access, and secure storage per DEA and state board regulations.

## 🔑 Inventory Concepts

- **Turnover Rate**  
  - How long inventory sits on the shelf before being used or sold  
  - 📌 **High turnover** = efficient inventory; **Low turnover** = potential waste or poor selection

- **PAR Levels (Periodic Automatic Replenishment)**  
  - Minimum stock thresholds that trigger reorder  
  - Prevents stockouts and overstocking

### 🗃️ Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual Inventory System**
  - Maintains a **real-time record** of inventory by updating whenever medications are received or dispensed.
    - Enables accurate audits at any point
  - 🔐 Required for **controlled substances (Schedules II–V)**.
  - Generates automatic reorders based on **PAR levels**.

- **Point of Sale (POS) System**
  - Deducts items from inventory **at the time of sale or dispensing**.
  - Helps in real-time tracking of stock levels through integration with pharmacy inventory management software.

- **Automated Dispensing Systems (ADS)**
  - Use **computerized cabinets or robotics** to manage inventory in institutional settings.
  - Improves accuracy, reduces diversion, and speeds up the dispensing process.
  - Often integrated with pharmacy inventory management software.

## 📅 Inventory Counting & Audits

### Initial Inventory

- Conducted before opening a new pharmacy or adding controlled substances to stock

### Cycle Counting

- Ongoing partial counts of inventory segments
- Used to detect loss or discrepancies in real time

### 🔐🦅 Biennial Inventory

- Required every 2 years under DEA rules
- Full controlled substance inventory by actual physical count
- Must be signed and dated by PIC

### Annual Physical Inventory

- Full inventory count of all medications and supplies
- Often required by company SOPs or state boards

### ⚠️ Discrepancy Reporting

- All inventory discrepancies must be:
  - **Documented promptly**
  - **Investigated thoroughly**
  - **Resolved with corrective actions**
- 🔐 **DEA Form 106** is required if loss or theft of controlled substances is confirmed

> 🛡️ Maintain accurate records to protect your license and ensure audit readiness.

## 💰 Purchasing

Pharmacies purchase stock from state-licensed:

- **Suppliers**: produce, label, and package drugs
- **Wholesalers**: purchase drugs in bulk and then sell them to medical facilities

> 🦅 See the [PDMA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#prescription-drug-marketing-act-pdma-1987) for regulations on manufacturer & wholesaler activities.

### 🏭 Suppliers

There are 3 main types of supplier: drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, and compounding pharmacies. All of them order raw materials or finished goods (like (in)active ingredients) to produce their goods. However, each one exists for a different scale of care.

- **Drug Manufacturers** package medication in standard dosage forms for mass distribution
- **Specialty Pharmacies** focus on providing high-cost, complex medications and specialized services to patients with chronic conditions
- **Compounding Pharmacies** customize medications on a patient-specific basic, often mixing, combinging, or altering existing drugs to meet individual needs

> 🦅 [340B](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#340b-drug-pricing-program-340b-1992) limits the cost safety-net providers, like medicaid, federally qualified health centers, and qualified hospitals paid for outpatient drugs through wholesalers.

### 🚚 Wholesalers

Wholesalers purchase drugs from manufactures in bulk and create wide distribution networks to ensure availability by storing their purchases in warehouses around the country so that deliveries can be made in 24-48 hours. They also drop ship lower-volume, high-cost medications on an as-needed basis.

### 📦 Manufacturer Labels & Drug Identification

Labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand; ensuring transparency and the prevention of deceptive packaging (see the [FPLA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#fair-packaging--labeling-act-fpla-1967)).

Manufacturer labels include:

- Manufacturer/distributor contact info
- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- Drug name, strength, & dosage form
- Net quantity of contents
- [NDCs](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#drug-listing-act-1972) (i.e. 11-digit, 3-segment identifier assigned to every marketed drug)
- Manufacture & expiration dates
- Batch/lot number
- Barcodes
  - **Linear Barcodes (1D)** appear as stripes that can be read forward or backwards and encodes NDC. Used for stock checks.
  - **Matrix Barcodes (2D)** appear as squares with black or white pixels; encoding NDC, batch, and expiration. Used in prescription filling to verify the correct product is being used.
- 🔐 DEA Schedule (if applicable)

> 🛡️ The ISMP encourages the use of **Tall Man Lettering** to differentiate look-alike/sound-alike drugs  
> Example: `predniSONE` vs. `prednisoLONE`
