# Pharmacy Inventory Management

Pharmacy inventory management ensures medications and supplies are available **in the right quantities, at the right time, and in suitable conditions** to support safe, efficient patient care. Proper systems reduce waste, lower costs, prevent shortages or overstocking, and ensure **regulatory compliance** through accurate tracking and documentation.

> ✅ Applies to all pharmacy personnel involved in procurement, storage, handling, and recordkeeping.

Pharmacy inventory includes:

- Prescription medications
- 💸 Over-the-counter (OTC) products
- 🔐 Controlled substances
- General pharmacy supplies (e.g., vials, labels, PPE)
- 📍 Durable and nondurable medical equipment dispensed with prescriptions

## 👤 Personnel Involved

- **Pharmacist-in-Charge (PIC)**:
  - Oversees inventory policies and procedures
  - Ensures compliance with federal and state laws
  - Approves final audits and discrepancy resolutions

- **Pharmacy Technicians**:
  - Perform daily inventory functions (stocking, returns, expiration checks)
  - Alert pharmacists to discrepancies or shortages
  - Monitor and maintain stock levels

- **Inventory Coordinator** (if assigned):
  - Manages order placements, receiving, and returns
  - Resolves shipment or record mismatches
  - Coordinates inventory cycle counts and physical audits

> 🔐 Controlled substances require additional documentation, restricted access, and secure storage per DEA and state board regulations.

## 🔑 Inventory Concepts

- **Turnover Rate**  
  - How long inventory sits on the shelf before being used or sold  
  - 📌 **High turnover** = efficient inventory; **Low turnover** = potential waste or poor selection

- **PAR Levels (Periodic Automatic Replenishment)**  
  - Minimum stock thresholds that trigger reorder  
  - Prevents stockouts and overstocking

### 🗃️ Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual Inventory System**
  - Maintains a **real-time record** of inventory by updating whenever medications are received or dispensed.
    - Enables accurate audits at any point
  - 🔐 Required for **controlled substances (Schedules II–V)**.
  - Generates automatic reorders based on **PAR levels**.

- **Point of Sale (POS) System**
  - Deducts items from inventory **at the time of sale or dispensing**.
  - Helps in real-time tracking of stock levels through integration with pharmacy inventory management software.

- **Automated Dispensing Systems (ADS)**
  - Use **computerized cabinets or robotics** to manage inventory in institutional settings.
  - Improves accuracy, reduces diversion, and speeds up the dispensing process.
  - Often integrated with pharmacy inventory management software.

## 📅 Inventory Counting & Audits

### Initial Inventory

- Conducted before opening a new pharmacy or adding controlled substances to stock

### Cycle Counting

- Ongoing partial counts of inventory segments
- Used to detect loss or discrepancies in real time

### 🔐🦅 Biennial Inventory

- Required every 2 years under DEA rules
- Full controlled substance inventory by actual physical count
- Must be signed and dated by PIC

### Annual Physical Inventory

- Full inventory count of all medications and supplies
- Often required by company SOPs or state boards

### ⚠️ Discrepancy Reporting

- All inventory discrepancies must be:
  - **Documented promptly**
  - **Investigated thoroughly**
  - **Resolved with corrective actions**
- 🔐 **DEA Form 106** is required if loss or theft of controlled substances is confirmed

> 🛡️ Maintain accurate records to protect your license and ensure audit readiness.

## 📦 Manufacturer Labels & Drug Identification

Labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand; ensuring transparency and the prevention of deceptive packaging (see the [FPLA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#fair-packaging--labeling-act-fpla-1967)).

Manufacturer labels include:

- Manufacturer/distributor contact info
- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- Drug name, strength, & dosage form
- Net quantity of contents
- [NDCs](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#drug-listing-act-1972) (i.e. 11-digit, 3-segment identifier assigned to every marketed drug)
- Manufacture & expiration dates
- Batch/lot number
- Barcodes
  - **Linear Barcodes (1D)** appear as stripes that can be read forward or backwards and encodes NDC. Used for stock checks.
  - **Matrix Barcodes (2D)** appear as squares with black or white pixels; encoding NDC, batch, and expiration. Used in prescription filling to verify the correct product is being used.
- 🔐 DEA Schedule (if applicable)

> 🛡️ The ISMP encourages the use of **Tall Man Lettering** to differentiate look-alike/sound-alike drugs  
> Example: `predniSONE` vs. `prednisoLONE`
