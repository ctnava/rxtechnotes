# Pharmacy Inventory Management

Pharmacy inventory management ensures medications and supplies are available **in the right quantities, at the right time, and in suitable conditions** to support safe, efficient patient care. Proper systems reduce waste, lower costs, prevent shortages or overstocking, and ensure **regulatory compliance** through accurate tracking and documentation.

> ✅ Applies to all pharmacy personnel involved in procurement, storage, handling, and recordkeeping.

Pharmacy inventory includes:

- Prescription medications
- 💸 Over-the-counter (OTC) products
- 🔐 Controlled substances
- General pharmacy supplies (e.g., vials, labels, PPE)
- 📍 Durable and nondurable medical equipment dispensed with prescriptions

## 👤 Personnel Involved

- **Pharmacist-in-Charge (PIC)**:
  - Oversees inventory policies and procedures
  - Ensures compliance with federal and state laws
  - Approves final audits and discrepancy resolutions

- **Pharmacy Technicians**:
  - Perform daily inventory functions (stocking, returns, expiration checks)
  - Alert pharmacists to discrepancies or shortages
  - Monitor and maintain stock levels

- **Inventory Coordinator** (if assigned):
  - Manages order placements, receiving, and returns
  - Resolves shipment or record mismatches
  - Coordinates inventory cycle counts and physical audits

> 🔐 Controlled substances require additional documentation, restricted access, and secure storage per DEA and state board regulations.  
> See: 🔗 [CSA/CMEA Broad Overview](./medications/controlled_listed_substances.md)

## 🔑 Inventory Concepts

- **Turnover Rate**  
  - How long inventory sits on the shelf before being used or sold  
  - 📌 **High turnover** = efficient inventory; **Low turnover** = potential waste or poor selection

- **PAR Levels (Periodic Automatic Replenishment)**  
  - Minimum stock thresholds that trigger reorder  
  - Prevents stockouts and overstocking

### 🗃️ Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual Inventory System**
  - Maintains a **real-time record** of inventory by updating whenever medications are received or dispensed when automated systems are properly integrated
    - Enables accurate audits at any point
  - 🔐 Required for **controlled substances (Schedules II–V)**.
  - Generates automatic reorders based on **PAR levels**.

- **Point of Sale (POS) System**
  - Deducts items from inventory **at the time of sale or dispensing**.
  - Helps in real-time tracking of stock levels through integration with pharmacy inventory management software.

- **Automated Dispensing Systems (ADS)**
  - Use **computerized cabinets or robotics** to manage inventory in institutional settings.
  - Improves accuracy, reduces diversion, and speeds up the dispensing process.
  - Often integrated with pharmacy inventory management software.

## 📅 Inventory Counting & Audits

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Inventory Counting & Discrepancy Reporting SOP Document Link -->

### Initial Inventory

- Conducted before opening a new pharmacy or adding controlled substances to stock

### Cycle Counting

- Ongoing partial counts of inventory segments
- Used to detect loss or discrepancies in real time

### 🔐🦅 Biennial Inventory

- Required every 2 years under DEA rules
- Full controlled substance inventory by actual physical count
- 🛡️ Signed and dated by PIC; Often required by many state boards or employers

### Annual Physical Inventory

- Full inventory count of all medications and supplies
- Often required by company SOPs or state boards

### ⚠️ Discrepancy Reporting

- All inventory discrepancies must be:
  - **Documented promptly**
  - **Investigated thoroughly**
  - **Resolved with corrective actions**
- 🔐 `DEA Form 106` is required if loss or theft of controlled substances is confirmed

> 🛡️ Maintain accurate records to protect your license and ensure audit readiness.

## 💰 Purchasing

<!-- Todo: 🔗 Ordering SOP Document Link -->

Pharmacies purchase stock from state-licensed:

- **Suppliers**: produce, label, and package drugs
- **Wholesalers**: purchase drugs in bulk and then sell them to medical facilities

> 🦅x🔐 FDA and DEA registration is also required for controlled substances.
> 🦅 See the 🔗 [PDMA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#prescription-drug-marketing-act-pdma-1987) for regulations on manufacturer & wholesaler activities.

### 🏭 Suppliers

There are 3 main types of supplier: drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, and compounding pharmacies. All of them order raw materials or finished goods (like (in)active ingredients) to produce their goods. However, each one exists for a different scale of care.

- **Drug Manufacturers** package medication in standard dosage forms for mass distribution
- **Specialty Pharmacies** focus on providing high-cost, complex medications and specialized services to patients with chronic conditions
- **Compounding Pharmacies** customize medications on a patient-specific basis, often mixing, combining, or altering existing drugs to meet individual needs

> 🦅 [340B](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#340b-drug-pricing-program-340b-1992) limits the cost safety-net providers, like medicaid, federally qualified health centers, and qualified hospitals paid for outpatient drugs through wholesalers.

### 🚚 Wholesalers

Wholesalers create regional and national distribution networks, storing bulk purchases in strategically placed warehouses to enable 24–48 hour delivery. They also drop ship lower-volume, high-cost medications on an as-needed basis.

### 📦 Manufacturer Labels & Drug Identification

Labels that are truthful, standardized, and easy for consumers to understand; ensuring transparency and the prevention of deceptive packaging (see the 🔗 [FPLA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#fair-packaging--labeling-act-fpla-1967)).

Manufacturer labels include:

- Manufacturer/distributor contact info
- The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor
- Drug name, strength, & dosage form
- Net quantity of contents
- 🔗 [NDCs](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#drug-listing-act-1972) (i.e. 11-digit, 3-segment identifier assigned to every marketed drug)
- Manufacture & expiration dates
- Batch/lot number
- Barcodes
  - **Linear Barcodes (1D)** appear as stripes that can be read forward or backwards and encodes NDC. Used for stock checks.
  - **Matrix Barcodes (2D)** appear as squares with black or white pixels; encoding NDC, batch, and expiration. Used in prescription filling to verify the correct product is being used. (Mandated by the 🔗 [DSCSA](./law/abbreviated_federal_law_reference.md#drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa-2013))
- 🔐 DEA Schedule (if applicable)

> 🛡️ The ISMP encourages the use of **Tall Man Lettering** to differentiate look-alike/sound-alike drugs  
> Example: `predniSONE` vs. `prednisoLONE`

## 🧹 Maintenance

- **Damaged stock**: [defintion]
- **Expired stock**: Medications past labeled expiration date. Typically in `YYYY/MM` format (good through the end of the month unless in `MM/DD/YYYY` format).
- **Discontinued Medications**: [definition]
- **Recalled Medications**: [definition]
  - **Class I**: Serious health hazard or death (e.g., wrong drug in bottle).
  - **Class II**: Temporary or reversible health effects.
  - **Class III**: Unlikely to cause harm but violates FDA standards.
- **Reverse distribution**: Process of returning expired/damaged products to authorized entities
