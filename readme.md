# Rx Tech Notes for CA State Licensure & National Certification

Welcome to my pharmacy technician notes for California state licensure & national certification.

## National Certification Tests

### Exam for the Certification of Pharmacy Technicians (ExCPT)

The ExCPT (Exam for the Certification of Pharmacy Technicians) is a 100-question, multiple-choice exam that tests a candidate's knowledge in three main areas:

- **The Dispensing Process** (55%): Covers all aspects of dispensing medications, from receiving and processing orders to preparing and dispensing prescriptions, as well as calculations, compounding, and sterile & nonsterile products
- **Laws & Regulations** (25%): Covers the role, scope of practice, and general duties of a pharmacy technician, as well as relevant laws and regulations, including those related to controlled substances
- **Drugs and Drug Therapy** (20%): Tests knowledge of drug classifications, frequently prescribed medications, and their mechanisms of action

It is a computer-based exam and requires one continuous session to complete. The exam also includes 20 pretest questions, which are not scored, and candidates are given 2 hours and 10 minutes to complete the test.

### Pharmacy Technician Certification Examination (PTCE)

The PTCE, or Pharmacy Technician Certification Examination, is a 2-hour computer-based exam with 90 multiple-choice questions (80 scored and 10 unscored). It evaluates knowledge in four key areas:

- **Medications** (40%): Covers generic and brand names, classifications, therapeutic equivalence, and drug interactions
- **Patient Safety & Quality Assurance** (26.25%): Covers high-alert medications, error prevention strategies, and quality assurance measures
- **Order Entry & Processing** (21.25%): Focuses on medication order entry, prescription filling, and related processes
- **Federal Requirements** (12.5%): Focuses on handling and disposal of pharmaceutical substances, controlled substance regulations (DEA), and federal agency requirements (DEA, FDA)
