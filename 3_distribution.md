## Allocating Medications to Patients

### General Designations

The **Durham-Humphrey Amendment** (1951) amendment established two classes of drugs: *legend* & *over-the-counter* (OTC).

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.
- **Legend**: Medications that may not be dispensed to the public except on the order or *prescription* of a licensed prescriber. These "prescription" drugs require a federal *legend* to appear on the packaging that states: "Federal law prohibits dispensing this medication without a prescription".
- **Over-the-Counter(OTC)**: Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are appropriately labeled for home use. OTC drugs are not inherently safe because they may have significant drug interactions with prescription medications. Technicians must refer patients who request them to pharmacists.

### Drug Selection

**Formularies** (i.e. a list of drugs approved and made available for use) are often used to decide which medications to dispense to patients. In a hospital setting, it refers to drugs that are stocked by the pharmacy and approved for use in the facility. In retail, It refers to an approved drug list associated with a particular insurance benefit plan.

#### Generic Substitution

Generic drugs make medicine more accessible as insurers are always ready to save money. However, inactive ingredients may affect tolerances and allergies in individual patients. If needed, insurers will cover brand name drugs if a doctor provides justification of medical necessity. Without justification or prior authorization, the patient usually must pay the full price without insurance coverage.

Technicians are generally expected to dispense generic drugs when available unless the prescriber specifies that the drug should be **Dispensed as Written (DAW)** or the inscription is for a hormone.

## Drug Distribution

Distribution of drugs is handled by suppliers, manufacturers, and wholesalers.

- **Suppliers**: produce, label, and package drugs
- **Wholesalers**: purchase drugs in bulk and then sell them to medical facilities

### Suppliers

There are 3 main types of supplier: drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, and compounding pharmacies. All of them order raw materials or finished goods (like (in)active ingredients) to produce their goods. However, each one exists for a different scale of care.

- **Drug Manufacturers** package medication in standard dosage forms for mass distribution
- **Specialty Pharmacies** focus on providing high-cost, complex medications and specialized services to patients with chronic conditions
- **Compounding Pharmacies** customize medications on a patient-specific basic, often mixing, combinging, or altering existing drugs to meet individual needs

### Wholesalers

Wholesalers generally purchase drugs from manufactures in bulk and must be licensed by the states they operate in for compliance with the 1987 **Prescription Drug Marketing Act**. These entities create wide distribution networks to ensure availability by storing their purchases in warehouses around the country so that deliveries can be made in 24-48 hours. They can also drop ship lower-volume, high-cost medications on an as-needed basis.

The federal **340B Drug Pricing Program** limits the cost safety-net providers, like medicaid, federally qualified health centers, and qualified hospitals paid for outpatient drugs through wholesalers.

### National Drug Code (NDC)

The **Drug Listing Act** of 1972 mandates that all drug establishments provide a complete list of drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for distribution, and these drugs must have a ***11-digit National Drug Code (NDC)***; a 3-segmented universal identifier. It's NATO-specific counterpart is called the NATO Stock Number (NSN).

Sample NDC: `12345-6789-01`

| Digits            | Name                      | Description                                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 12345             | Labeler Code (5 Digits)   | Identifies the manufacturer or distributor. Assigned by the FDA. |
| 6789              | Product Code (4 Digits)   | Identifies a specific strength, dosage form, and formulation.    |
| 01                | Package Code (2 Digits)   | Identifies package size and type.                                |

> **Note**: The NDC can appear in different segment configurations (5-4-2, 4-4-2, or 5-3-2), depending on how the manufacturer registered the drug with the FDA. When stored in databases, it is often reformatted as an 11-digit number (with leading zeroes added if needed).
