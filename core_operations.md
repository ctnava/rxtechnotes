# Core Pharmacy Operations & Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

## 📞 Customer Service

Pharmacy technicians must answer calls promptly, communicate clearly and respectfully, gather accurate information, and route clinical inquiries appropriately to ensure professional, accurate, and HIPAA-compliant telephone communication with patients, providers, and other parties contacting the pharmacy.

🔗 [Answering Pharmacy Phone Calls SOP](./sop/answering_phone.md)

**Retail technicians are the first point of contact for most patients**. Professional demeanor, clear communication, and operational efficiency are critical for ensuring medication safety and customer satisfaction.

- Listen actively and make eye contact  
- Confirm understanding by repeating concerns  
- Use a respectful, positive tone  
- Refer to patients by name when possible  
- Identify the pharmacy when answering the phone  
- Always follow facility policies and procedures  
- Refer all clinical questions to the pharmacist

## Legal Designations of Drugs

Federal and state law divide drugs into major categories based on how they may be distributed, their potential for abuse, and required labeling.

- 🔗 [The Durham-Humphrey Amendment](./law/fda_fdca.md#durham-humphrey-amendment-1951)
- 🔗 [Controlled & Listed Substance Policy](./law/csa_cmea.md)

### 💊 Legend Drugs

Prescription-only medications authorized under the **Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951)**. These drugs:

- Must be dispensed **only** on the **written, electronic, or verbal order** of a licensed prescriber.
- Require the **federal legend** on the manufacturer’s label:
  > "Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without a prescription"  
  or  
  > "Rx Only"
- Include:
  - **Non-controlled prescription medications** (e.g. antibiotics, blood pressure drugs)
  - **Controlled substances** (see below)

#### 🔐 Controlled Substances

- **Regulated by the DEA** under the **Controlled Substances Act (1970)**.
- Categorized into **Schedules I-V** based on **abuse potential**, **medical use**, and **dependence risk**.
- Subject to strict handling, labeling, inventory, and security requirements.
- Dispensing often involves:
  - 🦅 **ID verification** and limited refill authorizations
  - 🐻 `7 year recordkeeping` & CURES reporting requirement in California

> 📌 Pharmacists & Prescribers are equally liable for patient incidences involving CII medications. **Technicians** will be held liable for misconduct or negligence even while following orders.

### 💸 Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs

Medications that may be sold without a prescription as long as they are:

- Properly labeled for **self-directed use**
- Contain **adequate directions and warnings** for consumers
- Considered **safe and effective** when used as directed

Examples: `Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, loratadine`

**OTC drugs are not inherently safe** just because they don’t require a prescription. Many OTC medications can cause significant drug interactions, adverse effects, or even life-threatening complications; especially when combined with prescription drugs or taken incorrectly.

> 📌 OTC medications do not require a prescription but sometimes they are written for them.

When performing **medication reconciliation** (the process of gathering a patient’s full medication history), pharmacy technicians must:

- **Ask about all OTC medications**, supplements, and herbal products
- **Document** them in the patient’s profile
- **Refer patients to the pharmacist** for counseling if any concerns arise

> 📌 Technicians may direct customers to a product but should involve the pharmacist when making recommendations

## Orders & Prescriptions

Instructions from a medical practictioner, that authorizes the issue of a drug or device to a patient, can come in one of two forms:

- **Medication Orders**: a written request on a physician's order form OR a transcribed verbal/ telephone order in an *inpatient* setting.
- **Prescription**: medication order on a prescription blank to be filled in an *outpatient/ ambulatory* setting.

### Intake & Entry

When a patient shows up to the pharmacy for the first time, they usually bring a prescription with them. In these instances, the technician must follow appropriate procedures for **New Patient Intake** before proceeding to **Prescription Intake & Order Entry**.

🛠️ **Standard Operating Procedures**

- 🔗 [New Patient Intake](./sop/new_patient_intake.md)
- 🔗 [Prescription Intake & Order Entry](./sop/prescription_intake.md)

### 🔄 Refills & Renewal Requests

Each prescription is assigned a **prescription number**, which stays the same for all refills. The number of authorized refills is written by the prescriber and usually printed on the **prescription label**. If a doctor authorizes multiple refills (often written as ‘Refills: 3’ or ‘Refills: PRN’), they are valid for **up to 1 year** from the date the prescription was written, **except for controlled substances**, which have stricter limits.

Refills can be requested:

- 📱 Via smartphone apps  
- 💻 Through pharmacy websites  
- 🤝 In person  
- ☎️ Over the phone

> 📌 Involve the pharmacist immediately if the patient is requesting an early refill for controlled substances.

When a prescription has no refills or is expired, the technician is requesting a new prescription, not a ‘refill’ in the legal sense. **Pharmacy technicians** may be authorized to contact the prescriber **on behalf of the patient** to request a new prescription.

🔗 [Prescription Renewals SOP](./sop/refill_renewal_request.md)

### Prescription Transfers

Prescriptions may be transferred to another pharmacy at the request of a patient. State laws vary when it comes to different classes of drugs. Technicians may pull up the relevant records for transfer, however the pharmacist is responsible for the actual act of sending or receiving prescriptions.

🔗 [Prescription Transfer SOP](./sop/rx_xfer.md)

## Filling or Preparing Prescriptions

After prescriptions are accurately entered and verified in the system, technicians must follow standardized protocols to ensure safe, legal, and efficient dispensing of medications.

🔗 [Prescription Filling SOP](./sop/rx_fill.md)

### 🧩 Partial Fills

A **partial fill** occurs when a pharmacy dispenses **less than the total prescribed quantity** of a medication. This is commonly due to:

- ⛔ **Inventory shortages**
- ⏳ **Prescriber instructions** (e.g. titration schedules)
- 🔐 **Controlled substance regulations** under **21 CFR §1306.13** (🦅) and **CCR §1745** (🐻)

> ✅ Documentation of quantity dispensed, quantity remaining, and follow-up date is required  
> 🧑‍⚕️ Controlled partial fills may have stricter limits and expiration windows depending on the schedule

🔗 [Partial Filling SOP](./sop/partial_fills.md)

## 🔔 Prescription Pickup & Handoff

Pharmacy technicians play a key role at the final stage of the dispensing process. This involves:

- 📇 Verifying patient identity using at least two identifiers  
- 🔐 Complying with federal and state regulations for controlled substances  
- 🧑‍⚕️ Offering pharmacist counseling when required or appropriate  
- ✍️ Documenting the pickup for insurance and audit trails  
- ✅ Ensuring the prescription is handed off to the correct individual with proper tracking

> 🧾 Pickup is a regulated point-of-contact and must be handled with accuracy and professionalism
